0|From fairest creatures we desire increase ,
1|That thereby beauty 's rose might never die ,
2|But as the riper should by time decease ,
3|His tender heir might bear his memory :
4|But thou , contracted to thine own bright eyes ,
5|Feed ` st thy light 's flame with self-substantial fuel ,
6|Making a famine where abundance lies ,
7|Thy self thy foe , to thy sweet self too cruel :
8|Thou that art now the world 's fresh ornament ,
9|And only herald to the gaudy spring ,
10|Within thine own bud buriest thy content ,
11|And tender churl mak ` st waste in niggarding :
12|Pity the world , or else this glutton be ,
13|To eat the world 's due , by the grave and thee .
14|When forty winters shall besiege thy brow ,
15|And dig deep trenches in thy beauty 's field ,
16|Thy youth 's proud livery so gazed on now ,
17|Will be a tatter 'd weed of small worth held :
18|Then being asked , where all thy beauty lies ,
19|Where all the treasure of thy lusty days ;
20|To say , within thine own deep sunken eyes ,
21|Were an all-eating shame , and thriftless praise .
22|How much more praise deserv 'd thy beauty 's use ,
23|If thou couldst answer ` This fair child of mine
24|Shall sum my count , and make my old excuse , '
25|Proving his beauty by succession thine !
26|This were to be new made when thou art old ,
27|And see thy blood warm when thou feel ` st it cold .
28|Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
29|Now is the time that face should form another ;
30|Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest ,
31|Thou dost beguile the world , unbless some mother .
32|For where is she so fair whose unear 'd womb
33|Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry ?
34|Or who is he so fond will be the tomb ,
35|Of his self-love to stop posterity ?
36|Thou art thy mother 's glass and she in thee
37|Calls back the lovely April of her prime ;
38|So thou through windows of thine age shalt see ,
39|Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time .
40|But if thou live , remember 'd not to be ,
41|Die single and thine image dies with thee .
42|Unthrifty loveliness , why dost thou spend
43|Upon thy self thy beauty 's legacy ?
44|Nature 's bequest gives nothing , but doth lend ,
45|And being frank she lends to those are free :
46|Then , beauteous niggard , why dost thou abuse
47|The bounteous largess given thee to give ?
48|Profitless usurer , why dost thou use
49|So great a sum of sums , yet canst not live ?
50|For having traffic with thy self alone ,
51|Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive :
52|Then how when nature calls thee to be gone ,
53|What acceptable audit canst thou leave ?
54|Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee ,
55|Which , used , lives th ' executor to be .
56|Those hours , that with gentle work did frame
57|The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell ,
58|Will play the tyrants to the very same
59|And that unfair which fairly doth excel ;
60|For never-resting time leads summer on
61|To hideous winter , and confounds him there ;
62|Sap checked with frost , and lusty leaves quite gone ,
63|Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where :
64|Then were not summer 's distillation left ,
65|A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass ,
66|Beauty 's effect with beauty were bereft ,
67|Nor it , nor no remembrance what it was :
68|But flowers distill 'd , though they with winter meet ,
69|Leese but their show ; their substance still lives sweet .
70|Then let not winter 's ragged hand deface ,
71|In thee thy summer , ere thou be distill 'd :
72|Make sweet some vial ; treasure thou some place
73|With beauty 's treasure ere it be self-kill 'd .
74|That use is not forbidden usury ,
75|Which happies those that pay the willing loan ;
76|That 's for thy self to breed another thee ,
77|Or ten times happier , be it ten for one ;
78|Ten times thy self were happier than thou art ,
79|If ten of thine ten times refigur 'd thee :
80|Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart ,
81|Leaving thee living in posterity ?
82|Be not self-will 'd , for thou art much too fair
83|To be death 's conquest and make worms thine heir .
84|Lo ! in the orient when the gracious light
85|Lifts up his burning head , each under eye
86|Doth homage to his new-appearing sight ,
87|Serving with looks his sacred majesty ;
88|And having climb 'd the steep-up heavenly hill ,
89|Resembling strong youth in his middle age ,
90|Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still ,
91|Attending on his golden pilgrimage :
92|But when from highmost pitch , with weary car ,
93|Like feeble age , he reeleth from the day ,
94|The eyes , ` fore duteous , now converted are
95|From his low tract , and look another way :
96|So thou , thyself outgoing in thy noon :
97|Unlook 'd , on diest unless thou get a son .
98|Music to hear , why hear ` st thou music sadly ?
99|Sweets with sweets war not , joy delights in joy :
100|Why lov ` st thou that which thou receiv ` st not gladly ,
101|Or else receiv ` st with pleasure thine annoy ?
102|If the true concord of well-tuned sounds ,
103|By unions married , do offend thine ear ,
104|They do but sweetly chide thee , who confounds
105|In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear .
106|Mark how one string , sweet husband to another ,
107|Strikes each in each by mutual ordering ;
108|Resembling sire and child and happy mother ,
109|Who , all in one , one pleasing note do sing :
110|Whose speechless song being many , seeming one ,
111|Sings this to thee : ` Thou single wilt prove none . '
112|Is it for fear to wet a widow 's eye ,
113|That thou consum ` st thy self in single life ?
114|Ah ! if thou issueless shalt hap to die ,
115|The world will wail thee like a makeless wife ;
116|The world will be thy widow and still weep
117|That thou no form of thee hast left behind ,
118|When every private widow well may keep
119|By children 's eyes , her husband 's shape in mind :
120|Look ! what an unthrift in the world doth spend
121|Shifts but his place , for still the world enjoys it ;
122|But beauty 's waste hath in the world an end ,
123|And kept unused the user so destroys it .
124|No love toward others in that bosom sits
125|That on himself such murd ` rous shame commits .
126|For shame ! deny that thou bear ` st love to any ,
127|Who for thy self art so unprovident .
128|Grant , if thou wilt , thou art belov 'd of many ,
129|But that thou none lov ` st is most evident :
130|For thou art so possess 'd with murderous hate ,
131|That ` gainst thy self thou stick ` st not to conspire ,
132|Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
133|Which to repair should be thy chief desire .
134|O ! change thy thought , that I may change my mind :
135|Shall hate be fairer lodg 'd than gentle love ?
136|Be , as thy presence is , gracious and kind ,
137|Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove :
138|Make thee another self for love of me ,
139|That beauty still may live in thine or thee .
140|As fast as thou shalt wane , so fast thou grow ` st ,
141|In one of thine , from that which thou departest ;
142|And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow ` st ,
143|Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest ,
144|Herein lives wisdom , beauty , and increase ;
145|Without this folly , age , and cold decay :
146|If all were minded so , the times should cease
147|And threescore year would make the world away .
148|Let those whom nature hath not made for store ,
149|Harsh , featureless , and rude , barrenly perish :
150|Look , whom she best endow 'd , she gave thee more ;
151|Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish :
152|She carv 'd thee for her seal , and meant thereby ,
153|Thou shouldst print more , not let that copy die .
154|When I do count the clock that tells the time ,
155|And see the brave day sunk in hideous night ;
156|When I behold the violet past prime ,
157|And sable curls , all silvered o'er with white ;
158|When lofty trees I see barren of leaves ,
159|Which erst from heat did canopy the herd ,
160|And summer 's green all girded up in sheaves ,
161|Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard ,
162|Then of thy beauty do I question make ,
163|That thou among the wastes of time must go ,
164|Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
165|And die as fast as they see others grow ;
166|And nothing ` gainst Time 's scythe can make defence
167|Save breed , to brave him when he takes thee hence .
168|O ! that you were your self ; but , love you are
169|No longer yours , than you your self here live :
170|Against this coming end you should prepare ,
171|And your sweet semblance to some other give :
172|So should that beauty which you hold in lease
173|Find no determination ; then you were
174|Yourself again , after yourself 's decease ,
175|When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear .
176|Who lets so fair a house fall to decay ,
177|Which husbandry in honour might uphold ,
178|Against the stormy gusts of winter 's day
179|And barren rage of death 's eternal cold ?
180|O ! none but unthrifts . Dear my love , you know ,
181|You had a father : let your son say so .
182|Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck ;
183|And yet methinks I have astronomy ,
184|But not to tell of good or evil luck ,
185|Of plagues , of dearths , or seasons ' quality ;
186|Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell ,
187|Pointing to each his thunder , rain and wind ,
188|Or say with princes if it shall go well
189|By oft predict that I in heaven find :
190|But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive ,
191|And constant stars in them I read such art
192|As ` Truth and beauty shall together thrive ,
193|If from thyself , to store thou wouldst convert ' ;
194|Or else of thee this I prognosticate :
195|` Thy end is truth 's and beauty 's doom and date . '
196|When I consider every thing that grows
197|Holds in perfection but a little moment ,
198|That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
199|Whereon the stars in secret influence comment ;
200|When I perceive that men as plants increase ,
201|Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky ,
202|Vaunt in their youthful sap , at height decrease ,
203|And wear their brave state out of memory ;
204|Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
205|Sets you most rich in youth before my sight ,
206|Where wasteful Time debateth with decay
207|To change your day of youth to sullied night ,
208|And all in war with Time for love of you ,
209|As he takes from you , I engraft you new .
210|But wherefore do not you a mightier way
211|Make war upon this bloody tyrant , Time ?
212|And fortify your self in your decay
213|With means more blessed than my barren rhyme ?
214|Now stand you on the top of happy hours ,
215|And many maiden gardens , yet unset ,
216|With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers ,
217|Much liker than your painted counterfeit :
218|So should the lines of life that life repair ,
219|Which this , Time 's pencil , or my pupil pen ,
220|Neither in inward worth nor outward fair ,
221|Can make you live your self in eyes of men .
222|To give away yourself , keeps yourself still ,
223|And you must live , drawn by your own sweet skill .
224|Who will believe my verse in time to come ,
225|If it were fill 'd with your most high deserts ?
226|Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
227|Which hides your life , and shows not half your parts .
228|If I could write the beauty of your eyes ,
229|And in fresh numbers number all your graces ,
230|The age to come would say ` This poet lies ;
231|Such heavenly touches ne'er touch 'd earthly faces . '
232|So should my papers , yellow 'd with their age ,
233|Be scorn 'd , like old men of less truth than tongue ,
234|And your true rights be term 'd a poet 's rage
235|And stretched metre of an antique song :
236|But were some child of yours alive that time ,
237|You should live twice , -- in it , and in my rhyme .
238|Shall I compare thee to a summer 's day ?
239|Thou art more lovely and more temperate :
240|Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May ,
241|And summer 's lease hath all too short a date :
242|Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines ,
243|And often is his gold complexion dimm 'd ,
244|And every fair from fair sometime declines ,
245|By chance , or nature 's changing course untrimm 'd :
246|But thy eternal summer shall not fade ,
247|Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow ` st ,
248|Nor shall death brag thou wander ` st in his shade ,
249|When in eternal lines to time thou grow ` st ,
250|So long as men can breathe , or eyes can see ,
251|So long lives this , and this gives life to thee .
252|Devouring Time , blunt thou the lion 's paws ,
253|And make the earth devour her own sweet brood ;
254|Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger 's jaws ,
255|And burn the long-liv 'd phoenix , in her blood ;
256|Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets ,
257|And do whate'er thou wilt , swift-footed Time ,
258|To the wide world and all her fading sweets ;
259|But I forbid thee one most heinous crime :
260|O ! carve not with thy hours my love 's fair brow ,
261|Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen ;
262|Him in thy course untainted do allow
263|For beauty 's pattern to succeeding men .
264|Yet , do thy worst old Time : despite thy wrong ,
265|My love shall in my verse ever live young .
266|A woman 's face with nature 's own hand painted ,
267|Hast thou , the master mistress of my passion ;
268|A woman 's gentle heart , but not acquainted
269|With shifting change , as is false women 's fashion :
270|An eye more bright than theirs , less false in rolling ,
271|Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth ;
272|A man in hue all ` hues ' in his controlling ,
273|Which steals men 's eyes and women 's souls amazeth .
274|And for a woman wert thou first created ;
275|Till Nature , as she wrought thee , fell a-doting ,
276|And by addition me of thee defeated ,
277|By adding one thing to my purpose nothing .
278|But since she prick 'd thee out for women 's pleasure ,
279|Mine be thy love and thy love 's use their treasure .
280|So is it not with me as with that Muse ,
281|Stirr 'd by a painted beauty to his verse ,
282|Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
283|And every fair with his fair doth rehearse ,
284|Making a couplement of proud compare .
285|With sun and moon , with earth and sea 's rich gems ,
286|With April 's first-born flowers , and all things rare ,
287|That heaven 's air in this huge rondure hems .
288|O ! let me , true in love , but truly write ,
289|And then believe me , my love is as fair
290|As any mother 's child , though not so bright
291|As those gold candles fix 'd in heaven 's air :
292|Let them say more that like of hearsay well ;
293|I will not praise that purpose not to sell .
294|My glass shall not persuade me I am old ,
295|So long as youth and thou are of one date ;
296|But when in thee time 's furrows I behold ,
297|Then look I death my days should expiate .
298|For all that beauty that doth cover thee ,
299|Is but the seemly raiment of my heart ,
300|Which in thy breast doth live , as thine in me :
301|How can I then be elder than thou art ?
302|O ! therefore love , be of thyself so wary
303|As I , not for myself , but for thee will ;
304|Bearing thy heart , which I will keep so chary
305|As tender nurse her babe from faring ill .
306|Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain ,
307|Thou gav ` st me thine not to give back again .
308|As an unperfect actor on the stage ,
309|Who with his fear is put beside his part ,
310|Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage ,
311|Whose strength 's abundance weakens his own heart ;
312|So I , for fear of trust , forget to say
313|The perfect ceremony of love 's rite ,
314|And in mine own love 's strength seem to decay ,
315|O'ercharg 'd with burthen of mine own love 's might .
316|O ! let my looks be then the eloquence
317|And dumb presagers of my speaking breast ,
318|Who plead for love , and look for recompense ,
319|More than that tongue that more hath more express 'd .
320|O ! learn to read what silent love hath writ :
321|To hear with eyes belongs to love 's fine wit .
322|Mine eye hath play 'd the painter and hath stell 'd ,
323|Thy beauty 's form in table of my heart ;
324|My body is the frame wherein ` tis held ,
325|And perspective it is best painter 's art .
326|For through the painter must you see his skill ,
327|To find where your true image pictur 'd lies ,
328|Which in my bosom 's shop is hanging still ,
329|That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes .
330|Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done :
331|Mine eyes have drawn thy shape , and thine for me
332|Are windows to my breast , where-through the sun
333|Delights to peep , to gaze therein on thee ;
334|Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art ,
335|They draw but what they see , know not the heart .
336|Let those who are in favour with their stars
337|Of public honour and proud titles boast ,
338|Whilst I , whom fortune of such triumph bars
339|Unlook 'd for joy in that I honour most .
340|Great princes ' favourites their fair leaves spread
341|But as the marigold at the sun 's eye ,
342|And in themselves their pride lies buried ,
343|For at a frown they in their glory die .
344|The painful warrior famoused for fight ,
345|After a thousand victories once foil 'd ,
346|Is from the book of honour razed quite ,
347|And all the rest forgot for which he toil 'd :
348|Then happy I , that love and am belov 'd ,
349|Where I may not remove nor be remov 'd .
350|Lord of my love , to whom in vassalage
351|Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit ,
352|To thee I send this written embassage ,
353|To witness duty , not to show my wit :
354|Duty so great , which wit so poor as mine
355|May make seem bare , in wanting words to show it ,
356|But that I hope some good conceit of thine
357|In thy soul 's thought , all naked , will bestow it :
358|Till whatsoever star that guides my moving ,
359|Points on me graciously with fair aspect ,
360|And puts apparel on my tatter 'd loving ,
361|To show me worthy of thy sweet respect :
362|Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee ;
363|Till then , not show my head where thou mayst prove me .
364|Weary with toil , I haste me to my bed ,
365|The dear respose for limbs with travel tir 'd ;
366|But then begins a journey in my head
367|To work my mind , when body 's work 's expired :
368|For then my thoughts -- from far where I abide --
369|Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee ,
370|And keep my drooping eyelids open wide ,
371|Looking on darkness which the blind do see :
372|Save that my soul 's imaginary sight
373|Presents thy shadow to my sightless view ,
374|Which , like a jewel hung in ghastly night ,
375|Makes black night beauteous , and her old face new .
376|Lo ! thus , by day my limbs , by night my mind ,
377|For thee , and for myself , no quiet find .
378|How can I then return in happy plight ,
379|That am debarre 'd the benefit of rest ?
380|When day 's oppression is not eas 'd by night ,
381|But day by night and night by day oppress 'd ,
382|And each , though enemies to either 's reign ,
383|Do in consent shake hands to torture me ,
384|The one by toil , the other to complain
385|How far I toil , still farther off from thee .
386|I tell the day , to please him thou art bright ,
387|And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven :
388|So flatter I the swart-complexion 'd night ,
389|When sparkling stars twire not thou gild ` st the even .
390|But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer ,
391|And night doth nightly make grief 's length seem stronger .
392|When in disgrace with fortune and men 's eyes
393|I all alone beweep my outcast state ,
394|And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries ,
395|And look upon myself , and curse my fate ,
396|Wishing me like to one more rich in hope ,
397|Featur 'd like him , like him with friends possess 'd ,
398|Desiring this man 's art , and that man 's scope ,
399|With what I most enjoy contented least ;
400|Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising ,
401|Haply I think on thee , -- and then my state ,
402|Like to the lark at break of day arising
403|From sullen earth , sings hymns at heaven 's gate ;
404|For thy sweet love remember 'd such wealth brings
405|That then I scorn to change my state with kings .
406|When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
407|I summon up remembrance of things past ,
408|I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought ,
409|And with old woes new wail my dear time 's waste :
410|Then can I drown an eye , unused to flow ,
411|For precious friends hid in death 's dateless night ,
412|And weep afresh love 's long since cancell 'd woe ,
413|And moan the expense of many a vanish 'd sight :
414|Then can I grieve at grievances foregone ,
415|And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
416|The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan ,
417|Which I new pay as if not paid before .
418|But if the while I think on thee , dear friend ,
419|All losses are restor 'd and sorrows end .
420|Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts ,
421|Which I by lacking have supposed dead ;
422|And there reigns Love , and all Love 's loving parts ,
423|And all those friends which I thought buried .
424|How many a holy and obsequious tear
425|Hath dear religious love stol 'n from mine eye ,
426|As interest of the dead , which now appear
427|But things remov 'd that hidden in thee lie !
428|Thou art the grave where buried love doth live ,
429|Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone ,
430|Who all their parts of me to thee did give ,
431|That due of many now is thine alone :
432|Their images I lov 'd , I view in thee ,
433|And thou -- all they -- hast all the all of me .
434|If thou survive my well-contented day ,
435|When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
436|And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
437|These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover ,
438|Compare them with the bett ` ring of the time ,
439|And though they be outstripp 'd by every pen ,
440|Reserve them for my love , not for their rhyme ,
441|Exceeded by the height of happier men .
442|O ! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought :
443|` Had my friend 's Muse grown with this growing age ,
444|A dearer birth than this his love had brought ,
445|To march in ranks of better equipage :
446|But since he died and poets better prove ,
447|Theirs for their style I 'll read , his for his love ' .
448|Full many a glorious morning have I seen
449|Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye ,
450|Kissing with golden face the meadows green ,
451|Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy ;
452|Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
453|With ugly rack on his celestial face ,
454|And from the forlorn world his visage hide ,
455|Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace :
456|Even so my sun one early morn did shine ,
457|With all triumphant splendour on my brow ;
458|But out ! alack ! he was but one hour mine ,
459|The region cloud hath mask 'd him from me now .
460|Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth ;
461|Suns of the world may stain when heaven 's sun staineth .
462|Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day ,
463|And make me travel forth without my cloak ,
464|To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way ,
465|Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke ?
466|` Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break ,
467|To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face ,
468|For no man well of such a salve can speak ,
469|That heals the wound , and cures not the disgrace :
470|Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief ;
471|Though thou repent , yet I have still the loss :
472|The offender 's sorrow lends but weak relief
473|To him that bears the strong offence 's cross .
474|Ah ! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds ,
475|And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds .
476|No more be griev 'd at that which thou hast done :
477|Roses have thorns , and silver fountains mud :
478|Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun ,
479|And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud .
480|All men make faults , and even I in this ,
481|Authorizing thy trespass with compare ,
482|Myself corrupting , salving thy amiss ,
483|Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are ;
484|For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense , --
485|Thy adverse party is thy advocate , --
486|And ` gainst myself a lawful plea commence :
487|Such civil war is in my love and hate ,
488|That I an accessary needs must be ,
489|To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me .
490|Let me confess that we two must be twain ,
491|Although our undivided loves are one :
492|So shall those blots that do with me remain ,
493|Without thy help , by me be borne alone .
494|In our two loves there is but one respect ,
495|Though in our lives a separable spite ,
496|Which though it alter not love 's sole effect ,
497|Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love 's delight .
498|I may not evermore acknowledge thee ,
499|Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame ,
500|Nor thou with public kindness honour me ,
501|Unless thou take that honour from thy name :
502|But do not so , I love thee in such sort ,
503|As thou being mine , mine is thy good report .
504|As a decrepit father takes delight
505|To see his active child do deeds of youth ,
506|So I , made lame by Fortune 's dearest spite ,
507|Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth ;
508|For whether beauty , birth , or wealth , or wit ,
509|Or any of these all , or all , or more ,
510|Entitled in thy parts , do crowned sit ,
511|I make my love engrafted , to this store :
512|So then I am not lame , poor , nor despis 'd ,
513|Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
514|That I in thy abundance am suffic 'd ,
515|And by a part of all thy glory live .
516|Look what is best , that best I wish in thee :
517|This wish I have ; then ten times happy me !
518|How can my muse want subject to invent ,
519|While thou dost breathe , that pour ` st into my verse
520|Thine own sweet argument , too excellent
521|For every vulgar paper to rehearse ?
522|O ! give thy self the thanks , if aught in me
523|Worthy perusal stand against thy sight ;
524|For who 's so dumb that can not write to thee ,
525|When thou thy self dost give invention light ?
526|Be thou the tenth Muse , ten times more in worth
527|Than those old nine which rhymers invocate ;
528|And he that calls on thee , let him bring forth
529|Eternal numbers to outlive long date .
530|If my slight muse do please these curious days ,
531|The pain be mine , but thine shall be the praise .
532|O ! how thy worth with manners may I sing ,
533|When thou art all the better part of me ?
534|What can mine own praise to mine own self bring ?
535|And what is ' t but mine own when I praise thee ?
536|Even for this , let us divided live ,
537|And our dear love lose name of single one ,
538|That by this separation I may give
539|That due to thee which thou deserv ` st alone .
540|O absence ! what a torment wouldst thou prove ,
541|Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave ,
542|To entertain the time with thoughts of love ,
543|Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive ,
544|And that thou teachest how to make one twain ,
545|By praising him here who doth hence remain .
546|Take all my loves , my love , yea take them all ;
547|What hast thou then more than thou hadst before ?
548|No love , my love , that thou mayst true love call ;
549|All mine was thine , before thou hadst this more .
550|Then , if for my love , thou my love receivest ,
551|I can not blame thee , for my love thou usest ;
552|But yet be blam 'd , if thou thy self deceivest
553|By wilful taste of what thyself refusest .
554|I do forgive thy robbery , gentle thief ,
555|Although thou steal thee all my poverty :
556|And yet , love knows it is a greater grief
557|To bear love 's wrong , than hate 's known injury .
558|Lascivious grace , in whom all ill well shows ,
559|Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes .
560|Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits ,
561|When I am sometime absent from thy heart ,
562|Thy beauty , and thy years full well befits ,
563|For still temptation follows where thou art .
564|Gentle thou art , and therefore to be won ,
565|Beauteous thou art , therefore to be assail 'd ;
566|And when a woman woos , what woman 's son
567|Will sourly leave her till he have prevail 'd ?
568|Ay me ! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear ,
569|And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth ,
570|Who lead thee in their riot even there
571|Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth : --
572|Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee ,
573|Thine by thy beauty being false to me .
574|That thou hast her it is not all my grief ,
575|And yet it may be said I loved her dearly ;
576|That she hath thee is of my wailing chief ,
577|A loss in love that touches me more nearly .
578|Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye :
579|Thou dost love her , because thou know ` st I love her ;
580|And for my sake even so doth she abuse me ,
581|Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her .
582|If I lose thee , my loss is my love 's gain ,
583|And losing her , my friend hath found that loss ;
584|Both find each other , and I lose both twain ,
585|And both for my sake lay on me this cross :
586|But here 's the joy ; my friend and I are one ;
587|Sweet flattery ! then she loves but me alone .
588|When most I wink , then do mine eyes best see ,
589|For all the day they view things unrespected ;
590|But when I sleep , in dreams they look on thee ,
591|And darkly bright , are bright in dark directed .
592|Then thou , whose shadow shadows doth make bright ,
593|How would thy shadow 's form form happy show
594|To the clear day with thy much clearer light ,
595|When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so !
596|How would , I say , mine eyes be blessed made
597|By looking on thee in the living day ,
598|When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
599|Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay !
600|All days are nights to see till I see thee ,
601|And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me .
602|If the dull substance of my flesh were thought ,
603|Injurious distance should not stop my way ;
604|For then despite of space I would be brought ,
605|From limits far remote , where thou dost stay .
606|No matter then although my foot did stand
607|Upon the farthest earth remov 'd from thee ;
608|For nimble thought can jump both sea and land ,
609|As soon as think the place where he would be .
610|But , ah ! thought kills me that I am not thought ,
611|To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone ,
612|But that so much of earth and water wrought ,
613|I must attend time 's leisure with my moan ;
614|Receiving nought by elements so slow
615|But heavy tears , badges of either 's woe .
616|The other two , slight air , and purging fire
617|Are both with thee , wherever I abide ;
618|The first my thought , the other my desire ,
619|These present-absent with swift motion slide .
620|For when these quicker elements are gone
621|In tender embassy of love to thee ,
622|My life , being made of four , with two alone
623|Sinks down to death , oppress 'd with melancholy ;
624|Until life 's composition be recur 'd
625|By those swift messengers return 'd from thee ,
626|Who even but now come back again , assur 'd ,
627|Of thy fair health , recounting it to me :
628|This told , I joy ; but then no longer glad ,
629|I send them back again , and straight grow sad .
630|Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war ,
631|How to divide the conquest of thy sight ;
632|Mine eye my heart thy picture 's sight would bar ,
633|My heart mine eye the freedom of that right .
634|My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie , --
635|A closet never pierc 'd with crystal eyes --
636|But the defendant doth that plea deny ,
637|And says in him thy fair appearance lies .
638|To side this title is impannelled
639|A quest of thoughts , all tenants to the heart ;
640|And by their verdict is determined
641|The clear eye 's moiety , and the dear heart 's part :
642|As thus ; mine eye 's due is thy outward part ,
643|And my heart 's right , thy inward love of heart .
644|Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took ,
645|And each doth good turns now unto the other :
646|When that mine eye is famish 'd for a look ,
647|Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother ,
648|With my love 's picture then my eye doth feast ,
649|And to the painted banquet bids my heart ;
650|Another time mine eye is my heart 's guest ,
651|And in his thoughts of love doth share a part :
652|So , either by thy picture or my love ,
653|Thy self away , art present still with me ;
654|For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move ,
655|And I am still with them , and they with thee ;
656|Or , if they sleep , thy picture in my sight
657|Awakes my heart , to heart 's and eye 's delight .
658|How careful was I when I took my way ,
659|Each trifle under truest bars to thrust ,
660|That to my use it might unused stay
661|From hands of falsehood , in sure wards of trust !
662|But thou , to whom my jewels trifles are ,
663|Most worthy comfort , now my greatest grief ,
664|Thou best of dearest , and mine only care ,
665|Art left the prey of every vulgar thief .
666|Thee have I not lock 'd up in any chest ,
667|Save where thou art not , though I feel thou art ,
668|Within the gentle closure of my breast ,
669|From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part ;
670|And even thence thou wilt be stol 'n I fear ,
671|For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear .
672|Against that time , if ever that time come ,
673|When I shall see thee frown on my defects ,
674|When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum ,
675|Call 'd to that audit by advis 'd respects ;
676|Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass ,
677|And scarcely greet me with that sun , thine eye ,
678|When love , converted from the thing it was ,
679|Shall reasons find of settled gravity ;
680|Against that time do I ensconce me here ,
681|Within the knowledge of mine own desert ,
682|And this my hand , against my self uprear ,
683|To guard the lawful reasons on thy part :
684|To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws ,
685|Since why to love I can allege no cause .
686|How heavy do I journey on the way ,
687|When what I seek , my weary travel 's end ,
688|Doth teach that ease and that repose to say ,
689|` Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend ! '
690|The beast that bears me , tired with my woe ,
691|Plods dully on , to bear that weight in me ,
692|As if by some instinct the wretch did know
693|His rider lov 'd not speed , being made from thee :
694|The bloody spur can not provoke him on ,
695|That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide ,
696|Which heavily he answers with a groan ,
697|More sharp to me than spurring to his side ;
698|For that same groan doth put this in my mind ,
699|My grief lies onward , and my joy behind .
700|Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
701|Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed :
702|From where thou art why should I haste me thence ?
703|Till I return , of posting is no need .
704|O ! what excuse will my poor beast then find ,
705|When swift extremity can seem but slow ?
706|Then should I spur , though mounted on the wind ,
707|In winged speed no motion shall I know ,
708|Then can no horse with my desire keep pace ;
709|Therefore desire , of perfect ` st love being made ,
710|Shall neigh -- no dull flesh -- in his fiery race ;
711|But love , for love , thus shall excuse my jade , --
712|` Since from thee going , he went wilful-slow ,
713|Towards thee I 'll run , and give him leave to go . '
714|So am I as the rich , whose blessed key ,
715|Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure ,
716|The which he will not every hour survey ,
717|For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure .
718|Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare ,
719|Since , seldom coming in that long year set ,
720|Like stones of worth they thinly placed are ,
721|Or captain jewels in the carcanet .
722|So is the time that keeps you as my chest ,
723|Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide ,
724|To make some special instant special-blest ,
725|By new unfolding his imprison 'd pride .
726|Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope ,
727|Being had , to triumph ; being lacked , to hope .
728|What is your substance , whereof are you made ,
729|That millions of strange shadows on you tend ?
730|Since every one , hath every one , one shade ,
731|And you but one , can every shadow lend .
732|Describe Adonis , and the counterfeit
733|Is poorly imitated after you ;
734|On Helen 's cheek all art of beauty set ,
735|And you in Grecian tires are painted new :
736|Speak of the spring , and foison of the year ,
737|The one doth shadow of your beauty show ,
738|The other as your bounty doth appear ;
739|And you in every blessed shape we know .
740|In all external grace you have some part ,
741|But you like none , none you , for constant heart .
742|O ! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
743|By that sweet ornament which truth doth give .
744|The rose looks fair , but fairer we it deem
745|For that sweet odour , which doth in it live .
746|The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
747|As the perfumed tincture of the roses .
748|Hang on such thorns , and play as wantonly
749|When summer 's breath their masked buds discloses :
750|But , for their virtue only is their show ,
751|They live unwoo 'd , and unrespected fade ;
752|Die to themselves . Sweet roses do not so ;
753|Of their sweet deaths , are sweetest odours made :
754|And so of you , beauteous and lovely youth ,
755|When that shall vade , by verse distills your truth .
756|Not marble , nor the gilded monuments
757|Of princes , shall outlive this powerful rhyme ;
758|But you shall shine more bright in these contents
759|Than unswept stone , besmear 'd with sluttish time .
760|When wasteful war shall statues overturn ,
761|And broils root out the work of masonry ,
762|Nor Mars his sword , nor war 's quick fire shall burn
763|The living record of your memory .
764|` Gainst death , and all-oblivious enmity
765|Shall you pace forth ; your praise shall still find room
766|Even in the eyes of all posterity
767|That wear this world out to the ending doom .
768|So , till the judgment that yourself arise ,
769|You live in this , and dwell in lovers ' eyes .
770|Sweet love , renew thy force ; be it not said
771|Thy edge should blunter be than appetite ,
772|Which but to-day by feeding is allay 'd ,
773|To-morrow sharpened in his former might :
774|So , love , be thou , although to-day thou fill
775|Thy hungry eyes , even till they wink with fulness ,
776|To-morrow see again , and do not kill
777|The spirit of love , with a perpetual dulness .
778|Let this sad interim like the ocean be
779|Which parts the shore , where two contracted new
780|Come daily to the banks , that when they see
781|Return of love , more blest may be the view ;
782|Or call it winter , which being full of care ,
783|Makes summer 's welcome , thrice more wished , more rare .
784|Being your slave what should I do but tend ,
785|Upon the hours , and times of your desire ?
786|I have no precious time at all to spend ;
787|Nor services to do , till you require .
788|Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour ,
789|Whilst I , my sovereign , watch the clock for you ,
790|Nor think the bitterness of absence sour ,
791|When you have bid your servant once adieu ;
792|Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
793|Where you may be , or your affairs suppose ,
794|But , like a sad slave , stay and think of nought
795|Save , where you are , how happy you make those .
796|So true a fool is love , that in your will ,
797|Though you do anything , he thinks no ill .
798|That god forbid , that made me first your slave ,
799|I should in thought control your times of pleasure ,
800|Or at your hand the account of hours to crave ,
801|Being your vassal , bound to stay your leisure !
802|O ! let me suffer , being at your beck ,
803|The imprison 'd absence of your liberty ;
804|And patience , tame to sufferance , bide each check ,
805|Without accusing you of injury .
806|Be where you list , your charter is so strong
807|That you yourself may privilage your time
808|To what you will ; to you it doth belong
809|Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime .
810|I am to wait , though waiting so be hell ,
811|Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well .
812|If there be nothing new , but that which is
813|Hath been before , how are our brains beguil 'd ,
814|Which labouring for invention bear amiss
815|The second burthen of a former child !
816|O ! that record could with a backward look ,
817|Even of five hundred courses of the sun ,
818|Show me your image in some antique book ,
819|Since mind at first in character was done !
820|That I might see what the old world could say
821|To this composed wonder of your frame ;
822|Wh ' r we are mended , or wh ' r better they ,
823|Or whether revolution be the same .
824|O ! sure I am the wits of former days ,
825|To subjects worse have given admiring praise .
826|Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore ,
827|So do our minutes hasten to their end ;
828|Each changing place with that which goes before ,
829|In sequent toil all forwards do contend .
830|Nativity , once in the main of light ,
831|Crawls to maturity , wherewith being crown 'd ,
832|Crooked eclipses ` gainst his glory fight ,
833|And Time that gave doth now his gift confound .
834|Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
835|And delves the parallels in beauty 's brow ,
836|Feeds on the rarities of nature 's truth ,
837|And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow :
838|And yet to times in hope , my verse shall stand .
839|Praising thy worth , despite his cruel hand .
840|Is it thy will , thy image should keep open
841|My heavy eyelids to the weary night ?
842|Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken ,
843|While shadows like to thee do mock my sight ?
844|Is it thy spirit that thou send ` st from thee
845|So far from home into my deeds to pry ,
846|To find out shames and idle hours in me ,
847|The scope and tenure of thy jealousy ?
848|O , no ! thy love , though much , is not so great :
849|It is my love that keeps mine eye awake :
850|Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat ,
851|To play the watchman ever for thy sake :
852|For thee watch I , whilst thou dost wake elsewhere ,
853|From me far off , with others all too near .
854|Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
855|And all my soul , and all my every part ;
856|And for this sin there is no remedy ,
857|It is so grounded inward in my heart .
858|Methinks no face so gracious is as mine ,
859|No shape so true , no truth of such account ;
860|And for myself mine own worth do define ,
861|As I all other in all worths surmount .
862|But when my glass shows me myself indeed
863|Beated and chopp 'd with tanned antiquity ,
864|Mine own self-love quite contrary I read ;
865|Self so self-loving were iniquity .
866|` Tis thee , -- myself , -- that for myself I praise ,
867|Painting my age with beauty of thy days .
868|Against my love shall be as I am now ,
869|With Time 's injurious hand crush 'd and o'erworn ;
870|When hours have drain 'd his blood and fill 'd his brow
871|With lines and wrinkles ; when his youthful morn
872|Hath travell 'd on to age 's steepy night ;
873|And all those beauties whereof now he 's king
874|Are vanishing , or vanished out of sight ,
875|Stealing away the treasure of his spring ;
876|For such a time do I now fortify
877|Against confounding age 's cruel knife ,
878|That he shall never cut from memory
879|My sweet love 's beauty , though my lover 's life :
880|His beauty shall in these black lines be seen ,
881|And they shall live , and he in them still green .
882|When I have seen by Time 's fell hand defac 'd
883|The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age ;
884|When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz 'd ,
885|And brass eternal slave to mortal rage ;
886|When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
887|Advantage on the kingdom of the shore ,
888|And the firm soil win of the watery main ,
889|Increasing store with loss , and loss with store ;
890|When I have seen such interchange of state ,
891|Or state itself confounded , to decay ;
892|Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate --
893|That Time will come and take my love away .
894|This thought is as a death which can not choose
895|But weep to have , that which it fears to lose .
896|Since brass , nor stone , nor earth , nor boundless sea ,
897|But sad mortality o'ersways their power ,
898|How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea ,
899|Whose action is no stronger than a flower ?
900|O ! how shall summer 's honey breath hold out ,
901|Against the wrackful siege of battering days ,
902|When rocks impregnable are not so stout ,
903|Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays ?
904|O fearful meditation ! where , alack ,
905|Shall Time 's best jewel from Time 's chest lie hid ?
906|Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back ?
907|Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid ?
908|O ! none , unless this miracle have might ,
909|That in black ink my love may still shine bright .
910|Tired with all these , for restful death I cry ,
911|As to behold desert a beggar born ,
912|And needy nothing trimm 'd in jollity ,
913|And purest faith unhappily forsworn ,
914|And gilded honour shamefully misplac 'd ,
915|And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted ,
916|And right perfection wrongfully disgrac 'd ,
917|And strength by limping sway disabled
918|And art made tongue-tied by authority ,
919|And folly -- doctor-like -- controlling skill ,
920|And simple truth miscall 'd simplicity ,
921|And captive good attending captain ill :
922|Tir 'd with all these , from these would I be gone ,
923|Save that , to die , I leave my love alone .
924|Ah ! wherefore with infection should he live ,
925|And with his presence grace impiety ,
926|That sin by him advantage should achieve ,
927|And lace itself with his society ?
928|Why should false painting imitate his cheek ,
929|And steel dead seeming of his living hue ?
930|Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
931|Roses of shadow , since his rose is true ?
932|Why should he live , now Nature bankrupt is ,
933|Beggar 'd of blood to blush through lively veins ?
934|For she hath no exchequer now but his ,
935|And proud of many , lives upon his gains .
936|O ! him she stores , to show what wealth she had
937|In days long since , before these last so bad .
938|Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn ,
939|When beauty lived and died as flowers do now ,
940|Before these bastard signs of fair were born ,
941|Or durst inhabit on a living brow ;
942|Before the golden tresses of the dead ,
943|The right of sepulchres , were shorn away ,
944|To live a second life on second head ;
945|Ere beauty 's dead fleece made another gay :
946|In him those holy antique hours are seen ,
947|Without all ornament , itself and true ,
948|Making no summer of another 's green ,
949|Robbing no old to dress his beauty new ;
950|And him as for a map doth Nature store ,
951|To show false Art what beauty was of yore .
952|Those parts of thee that the world 's eye doth view
953|Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend ;
954|All tongues -- the voice of souls -- give thee that due ,
955|Uttering bare truth , even so as foes commend .
956|Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown 'd ;
957|But those same tongues , that give thee so thine own ,
958|In other accents do this praise confound
959|By seeing farther than the eye hath shown .
960|They look into the beauty of thy mind ,
961|And that in guess they measure by thy deeds ;
962|Then -- churls -- their thoughts , although their eyes were kind ,
963|To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds :
964|But why thy odour matcheth not thy show ,
965|The soil is this , that thou dost common grow .
966|That thou art blam 'd shall not be thy defect ,
967|For slander 's mark was ever yet the fair ;
968|The ornament of beauty is suspect ,
969|A crow that flies in heaven 's sweetest air .
970|So thou be good , slander doth but approve
971|Thy worth the greater being woo 'd of time ;
972|For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love ,
973|And thou present ` st a pure unstained prime .
974|Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
975|Either not assail 'd , or victor being charg 'd ;
976|Yet this thy praise can not be so thy praise ,
977|To tie up envy , evermore enlarg 'd ,
978|If some suspect of ill mask 'd not thy show ,
979|Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe .
980|No longer mourn for me when I am dead
981|Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
982|Give warning to the world that I am fled
983|From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell :
984|Nay , if you read this line , remember not
985|The hand that writ it , for I love you so ,
986|That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot ,
987|If thinking on me then should make you woe .
988|O ! if , -- I say you look upon this verse ,
989|When I perhaps compounded am with clay ,
990|Do not so much as my poor name rehearse ;
991|But let your love even with my life decay ;
992|Lest the wise world should look into your moan ,
993|And mock you with me after I am gone .
994|O ! lest the world should task you to recite
995|What merit lived in me , that you should love
996|After my death , -- dear love , forget me quite ,
997|For you in me can nothing worthy prove ;
998|Unless you would devise some virtuous lie ,
999|To do more for me than mine own desert ,
1000|And hang more praise upon deceased I
1001|Than niggard truth would willingly impart :
1002|O ! lest your true love may seem false in this
1003|That you for love speak well of me untrue ,
1004|My name be buried where my body is ,
1005|And live no more to shame nor me nor you .
1006|For I am shamed by that which I bring forth ,
1007|And so should you , to love things nothing worth .
1008|That time of year thou mayst in me behold
1009|When yellow leaves , or none , or few , do hang
1010|Upon those boughs which shake against the cold ,
1011|Bare ruin 'd choirs , where late the sweet birds sang .
1012|In me thou see ` st the twilight of such day
1013|As after sunset fadeth in the west ;
1014|Which by and by black night doth take away ,
1015|Death 's second self , that seals up all in rest .
1016|In me thou see ` st the glowing of such fire ,
1017|That on the ashes of his youth doth lie ,
1018|As the death-bed , whereon it must expire ,
1019|Consum 'd with that which it was nourish 'd by .
1020|This thou perceiv ` st , which makes thy love more strong ,
1021|To love that well , which thou must leave ere long .
1022|But be contented : when that fell arrest
1023|Without all bail shall carry me away ,
1024|My life hath in this line some interest ,
1025|Which for memorial still with thee shall stay .
1026|When thou reviewest this , thou dost review
1027|The very part was consecrate to thee :
1028|The earth can have but earth , which is his due ;
1029|My spirit is thine , the better part of me :
1030|So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life ,
1031|The prey of worms , my body being dead ;
1032|The coward conquest of a wretch 's knife ,
1033|Too base of thee to be remembered .
1034|The worth of that is that which it contains ,
1035|And that is this , and this with thee remains .
1036|So are you to my thoughts as food to life ,
1037|Or as sweet-season 'd showers are to the ground ;
1038|And for the peace of you I hold such strife
1039|As ` twixt a miser and his wealth is found .
1040|Now proud as an enjoyer , and anon
1041|Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure ;
1042|Now counting best to be with you alone ,
1043|Then better 'd that the world may see my pleasure :
1044|Sometime all full with feasting on your sight ,
1045|And by and by clean starved for a look ;
1046|Possessing or pursuing no delight ,
1047|Save what is had , or must from you be took .
1048|Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day ,
1049|Or gluttoning on all , or all away .
1050|Why is my verse so barren of new pride ,
1051|So far from variation or quick change ?
1052|Why with the time do I not glance aside
1053|To new-found methods , and to compounds strange ?
1054|Why write I still all one , ever the same ,
1055|And keep invention in a noted weed ,
1056|That every word doth almost tell my name ,
1057|Showing their birth , and where they did proceed ?
1058|O ! know sweet love I always write of you ,
1059|And you and love are still my argument ;
1060|So all my best is dressing old words new ,
1061|Spending again what is already spent :
1062|For as the sun is daily new and old ,
1063|So is my love still telling what is told .
1064|Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear ,
1065|Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste ;
1066|These vacant leaves thy mind 's imprint will bear ,
1067|And of this book , this learning mayst thou taste .
1068|The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
1069|Of mouthed graves will give thee memory ;
1070|Thou by thy dial 's shady stealth mayst know
1071|Time 's thievish progress to eternity .
1072|Look ! what thy memory can not contain ,
1073|Commit to these waste blanks , and thou shalt find
1074|Those children nursed , deliver 'd from thy brain ,
1075|To take a new acquaintance of thy mind .
1076|These offices , so oft as thou wilt look ,
1077|Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book .
1078|So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse ,
1079|And found such fair assistance in my verse
1080|As every alien pen hath got my use
1081|And under thee their poesy disperse .
1082|Thine eyes , that taught the dumb on high to sing
1083|And heavy ignorance aloft to fly ,
1084|Have added feathers to the learned 's wing
1085|And given grace a double majesty .
1086|Yet be most proud of that which I compile ,
1087|Whose influence is thine , and born of thee :
1088|In others ' works thou dost but mend the style ,
1089|And arts with thy sweet graces graced be ;
1090|But thou art all my art , and dost advance
1091|As high as learning , my rude ignorance .
1092|Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid ,
1093|My verse alone had all thy gentle grace ;
1094|But now my gracious numbers are decay 'd ,
1095|And my sick Muse doth give an other place .
1096|I grant , sweet love , thy lovely argument
1097|Deserves the travail of a worthier pen ;
1098|Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
1099|He robs thee of , and pays it thee again .
1100|He lends thee virtue , and he stole that word
1101|From thy behaviour ; beauty doth he give ,
1102|And found it in thy cheek : he can afford
1103|No praise to thee , but what in thee doth live .
1104|Then thank him not for that which he doth say ,
1105|Since what he owes thee , thou thyself dost pay .
1106|O ! how I faint when I of you do write ,
1107|Knowing a better spirit doth use your name ,
1108|And in the praise thereof spends all his might ,
1109|To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame !
1110|But since your worth -- wide as the ocean is , --
1111|The humble as the proudest sail doth bear ,
1112|My saucy bark , inferior far to his ,
1113|On your broad main doth wilfully appear .
1114|Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat ,
1115|Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride ;
1116|Or , being wrack 'd , I am a worthless boat ,
1117|He of tall building , and of goodly pride :
1118|Then if he thrive and I be cast away ,
1119|The worst was this , -- my love was my decay .
1120|Or I shall live your epitaph to make ,
1121|Or you survive when I in earth am rotten ;
1122|From hence your memory death can not take ,
1123|Although in me each part will be forgotten .
1124|Your name from hence immortal life shall have ,
1125|Though I , once gone , to all the world must die :
1126|The earth can yield me but a common grave ,
1127|When you entombed in men 's eyes shall lie .
1128|Your monument shall be my gentle verse ,
1129|Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read ;
1130|And tongues to be , your being shall rehearse ,
1131|When all the breathers of this world are dead ;
1132|You still shall live , -- such virtue hath my pen , --
1133|Where breath most breathes , even in the mouths of men .
1134|I grant thou wert not married to my Muse ,
1135|And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
1136|The dedicated words which writers use
1137|Of their fair subject , blessing every book .
1138|Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue ,
1139|Finding thy worth a limit past my praise ;
1140|And therefore art enforced to seek anew
1141|Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days .
1142|And do so , love ; yet when they have devis 'd ,
1143|What strained touches rhetoric can lend ,
1144|Thou truly fair , wert truly sympathiz 'd
1145|In true plain words , by thy true-telling friend ;
1146|And their gross painting might be better us 'd
1147|Where cheeks need blood ; in thee it is abus 'd .
1148|I never saw that you did painting need ,
1149|And therefore to your fair no painting set ;
1150|I found , or thought I found , you did exceed
1151|That barren tender of a poet 's debt :
1152|And therefore have I slept in your report ,
1153|That you yourself , being extant , well might show
1154|How far a modern quill doth come too short ,
1155|Speaking of worth , what worth in you doth grow .
1156|This silence for my sin you did impute ,
1157|Which shall be most my glory being dumb ;
1158|For I impair not beauty being mute ,
1159|When others would give life , and bring a tomb .
1160|There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
1161|Than both your poets can in praise devise .
1162|Who is it that says most , which can say more ,
1163|Than this rich praise , -- that you alone , are you ?
1164|In whose confine immured is the store
1165|Which should example where your equal grew .
1166|Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
1167|That to his subject lends not some small glory ;
1168|But he that writes of you , if he can tell
1169|That you are you , so dignifies his story ,
1170|Let him but copy what in you is writ ,
1171|Not making worse what nature made so clear ,
1172|And such a counterpart shall fame his wit ,
1173|Making his style admired every where .
1174|You to your beauteous blessings add a curse ,
1175|Being fond on praise , which makes your praises worse .
1176|My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still ,
1177|While comments of your praise richly compil 'd ,
1178|Reserve their character with golden quill ,
1179|And precious phrase by all the Muses fil 'd .
1180|I think good thoughts , whilst others write good words ,
1181|And like unlettered clerk still cry ` Amen '
1182|To every hymn that able spirit affords ,
1183|In polish 'd form of well-refined pen .
1184|Hearing you praised , I say '' tis so , ` tis true , '
1185|And to the most of praise add something more ;
1186|But that is in my thought , whose love to you ,
1187|Though words come hindmost , holds his rank before .
1188|Then others , for the breath of words respect ,
1189|Me for my dumb thoughts , speaking in effect .
1190|Was it the proud full sail of his great verse ,
1191|Bound for the prize of all too precious you ,
1192|That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse ,
1193|Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew ?
1194|Was it his spirit , by spirits taught to write ,
1195|Above a mortal pitch , that struck me dead ?
1196|No , neither he , nor his compeers by night
1197|Giving him aid , my verse astonished .
1198|He , nor that affable familiar ghost
1199|Which nightly gulls him with intelligence ,
1200|As victors of my silence can not boast ;
1201|I was not sick of any fear from thence :
1202|But when your countenance fill 'd up his line ,
1203|Then lacked I matter ; that enfeebled mine .
1204|Farewell ! thou art too dear for my possessing ,
1205|And like enough thou know ` st thy estimate ,
1206|The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing ;
1207|My bonds in thee are all determinate .
1208|For how do I hold thee but by thy granting ?
1209|And for that riches where is my deserving ?
1210|The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting ,
1211|And so my patent back again is swerving .
1212|Thy self thou gav ` st , thy own worth then not knowing ,
1213|Or me to whom thou gav ` st it , else mistaking ;
1214|So thy great gift , upon misprision growing ,
1215|Comes home again , on better judgement making .
1216|Thus have I had thee , as a dream doth flatter ,
1217|In sleep a king , but waking no such matter .
1218|When thou shalt be dispos 'd to set me light ,
1219|And place my merit in the eye of scorn ,
1220|Upon thy side , against myself I 'll fight ,
1221|And prove thee virtuous , though thou art forsworn .
1222|With mine own weakness , being best acquainted ,
1223|Upon thy part I can set down a story
1224|Of faults conceal 'd , wherein I am attainted ;
1225|That thou in losing me shalt win much glory :
1226|And I by this will be a gainer too ;
1227|For bending all my loving thoughts on thee ,
1228|The injuries that to myself I do ,
1229|Doing thee vantage , double-vantage me .
1230|Such is my love , to thee I so belong ,
1231|That for thy right , myself will bear all wrong .
1232|Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault ,
1233|And I will comment upon that offence :
1234|Speak of my lameness , and I straight will halt ,
1235|Against thy reasons making no defence .
1236|Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill ,
1237|To set a form upon desired change ,
1238|As I 'll myself disgrace ; knowing thy will ,
1239|I will acquaintance strangle , and look strange ;
1240|Be absent from thy walks ; and in my tongue
1241|Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell ,
1242|Lest I , too much profane , should do it wrong ,
1243|And haply of our old acquaintance tell .
1244|For thee , against my self I 'll vow debate ,
1245|For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate .
1246|Then hate me when thou wilt ; if ever , now ;
1247|Now , while the world is bent my deeds to cross ,
1248|Join with the spite of fortune , make me bow ,
1249|And do not drop in for an after-loss :
1250|Ah ! do not , when my heart hath ` scap 'd this sorrow ,
1251|Come in the rearward of a conquer 'd woe ;
1252|Give not a windy night a rainy morrow ,
1253|To linger out a purpos 'd overthrow .
1254|If thou wilt leave me , do not leave me last ,
1255|When other petty griefs have done their spite ,
1256|But in the onset come : so shall I taste
1257|At first the very worst of fortune 's might ;
1258|And other strains of woe , which now seem woe ,
1259|Compar 'd with loss of thee , will not seem so .
1260|Some glory in their birth , some in their skill ,
1261|Some in their wealth , some in their body 's force ,
1262|Some in their garments though new-fangled ill ;
1263|Some in their hawks and hounds , some in their horse ;
1264|And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure ,
1265|Wherein it finds a joy above the rest :
1266|But these particulars are not my measure ,
1267|All these I better in one general best .
1268|Thy love is better than high birth to me ,
1269|Richer than wealth , prouder than garments ' costs ,
1270|Of more delight than hawks and horses be ;
1271|And having thee , of all men 's pride I boast :
1272|Wretched in this alone , that thou mayst take
1273|All this away , and me most wretchcd make .
1274|But do thy worst to steal thyself away ,
1275|For term of life thou art assured mine ;
1276|And life no longer than thy love will stay ,
1277|For it depends upon that love of thine .
1278|Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs ,
1279|When in the least of them my life hath end .
1280|I see a better state to me belongs
1281|Than that which on thy humour doth depend :
1282|Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind ,
1283|Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie .
1284|O ! what a happy title do I find ,
1285|Happy to have thy love , happy to die !
1286|But what 's so blessed-fair that fears no blot ?
1287|Thou mayst be false , and yet I know it not .
1288|So shall I live , supposing thou art true ,
1289|Like a deceived husband ; so love 's face
1290|May still seem love to me , though alter 'd new ;
1291|Thy looks with me , thy heart in other place :
1292|For there can live no hatred in thine eye ,
1293|Therefore in that I can not know thy change .
1294|In many 's looks , the false heart 's history
1295|Is writ in moods , and frowns , and wrinkles strange .
1296|But heaven in thy creation did decree
1297|That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell ;
1298|Whate'er thy thoughts , or thy heart 's workings be ,
1299|Thy looks should nothing thence , but sweetness tell .
1300|How like Eve 's apple doth thy beauty grow ,
1301|If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show !
1302|They that have power to hurt , and will do none ,
1303|That do not do the thing they most do show ,
1304|Who , moving others , are themselves as stone ,
1305|Unmoved , cold , and to temptation slow ;
1306|They rightly do inherit heaven 's graces ,
1307|And husband nature 's riches from expense ;
1308|They are the lords and owners of their faces ,
1309|Others , but stewards of their excellence .
1310|The summer 's flower is to the summer sweet ,
1311|Though to itself , it only live and die ,
1312|But if that flower with base infection meet ,
1313|The basest weed outbraves his dignity :
1314|For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds ;
1315|Lilies that fester , smell far worse than weeds .
1316|How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
1317|Which , like a canker in the fragrant rose ,
1318|Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name !
1319|O ! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose .
1320|That tongue that tells the story of thy days ,
1321|Making lascivious comments on thy sport ,
1322|Can not dispraise , but in a kind of praise ;
1323|Naming thy name , blesses an ill report .
1324|O ! what a mansion have those vices got
1325|Which for their habitation chose out thee ,
1326|Where beauty 's veil doth cover every blot
1327|And all things turns to fair that eyes can see !
1328|Take heed , dear heart , of this large privilege ;
1329|The hardest knife ill-us 'd doth lose his edge .
1330|Some say thy fault is youth , some wantonness ;
1331|Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport ;
1332|Both grace and faults are lov 'd of more and less :
1333|Thou mak ` st faults graces that to thee resort .
1334|As on the finger of a throned queen
1335|The basest jewel will be well esteem 'd ,
1336|So are those errors that in thee are seen
1337|To truths translated , and for true things deem 'd .
1338|How many lambs might the stern wolf betray ,
1339|If like a lamb he could his looks translate !
1340|How many gazers mightst thou lead away ,
1341|if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state !
1342|But do not so ; I love thee in such sort ,
1343|As , thou being mine , mine is thy good report .
1344|How like a winter hath my absence been
1345|From thee , the pleasure of the fleeting year !
1346|What freezings have I felt , what dark days seen !
1347|What old December 's bareness everywhere !
1348|And yet this time removed was summer 's time ;
1349|The teeming autumn , big with rich increase ,
1350|Bearing the wanton burden of the prime ,
1351|Like widow 'd wombs after their lords ' decease :
1352|Yet this abundant issue seem 'd to me
1353|But hope of orphans , and unfather 'd fruit ;
1354|For summer and his pleasures wait on thee ,
1355|And , thou away , the very birds are mute :
1356|Or , if they sing , ` tis with so dull a cheer ,
1357|That leaves look pale , dreading the winter 's near .
1358|From you have I been absent in the spring ,
1359|When proud-pied April , dress 'd in all his trim ,
1360|Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing ,
1361|That heavy Saturn laugh 'd and leap 'd with him .
1362|Yet nor the lays of birds , nor the sweet smell
1363|Of different flowers in odour and in hue ,
1364|Could make me any summer 's story tell ,
1365|Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew :
1366|Nor did I wonder at the lily 's white ,
1367|Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose ;
1368|They were but sweet , but figures of delight ,
1369|Drawn after you , you pattern of all those .
1370|Yet seem 'd it winter still , and you away ,
1371|As with your shadow I with these did play .
1372|The forward violet thus did I chide :
1373|Sweet thief , whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells ,
1374|If not from my love 's breath ? The purple pride
1375|Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
1376|In my love 's veins thou hast too grossly dy 'd .
1377|The lily I condemned for thy hand ,
1378|And buds of marjoram had stol 'n thy hair ;
1379|The roses fearfully on thorns did stand ,
1380|One blushing shame , another white despair ;
1381|A third , nor red nor white , had stol 'n of both ,
1382|And to his robbery had annex 'd thy breath ;
1383|But , for his theft , in pride of all his growth
1384|A vengeful canker eat him up to death .
1385|More flowers I noted , yet I none could see ,
1386|But sweet , or colour it had stol 'n from thee .
1387|Where art thou Muse that thou forget ` st so long ,
1388|To speak of that which gives thee all thy might ?
1389|Spend ` st thou thy fury on some worthless song ,
1390|Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light ?
1391|Return forgetful Muse , and straight redeem ,
1392|In gentle numbers time so idly spent ;
1393|Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
1394|And gives thy pen both skill and argument .
1395|Rise , resty Muse , my love 's sweet face survey ,
1396|If Time have any wrinkle graven there ;
1397|If any , be a satire to decay ,
1398|And make time 's spoils despised every where .
1399|Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life ,
1400|So thou prevent ` st his scythe and crooked knife .
1401|O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
1402|For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy 'd ?
1403|Both truth and beauty on my love depends ;
1404|So dost thou too , and therein dignified .
1405|Make answer Muse : wilt thou not haply say ,
1406|` Truth needs no colour , with his colour fix 'd ;
1407|Beauty no pencil , beauty 's truth to lay ;
1408|But best is best , if never intermix 'd ' ?
1409|Because he needs no praise , wilt thou be dumb ?
1410|Excuse not silence so , for ' t lies in thee
1411|To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
1412|And to be prais 'd of ages yet to be .
1413|Then do thy office , Muse ; I teach thee how
1414|To make him seem long hence as he shows now .
1415|My love is strengthen 'd , though more weak in seeming ;
1416|I love not less , though less the show appear ;
1417|That love is merchandiz 'd , whose rich esteeming ,
1418|The owner 's tongue doth publish every where .
1419|Our love was new , and then but in the spring ,
1420|When I was wont to greet it with my lays ;
1421|As Philomel in summer 's front doth sing ,
1422|And stops her pipe in growth of riper days :
1423|Not that the summer is less pleasant now
1424|Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night ,
1425|But that wild music burthens every bough ,
1426|And sweets grown common lose their dear delight .
1427|Therefore like her , I sometime hold my tongue :
1428|Because I would not dull you with my song .
1429|Alack ! what poverty my Muse brings forth ,
1430|That having such a scope to show her pride ,
1431|The argument , all bare , is of more worth
1432|Than when it hath my added praise beside !
1433|O ! blame me not , if I no more can write !
1434|Look in your glass , and there appears a face
1435|That over-goes my blunt invention quite ,
1436|Dulling my lines , and doing me disgrace .
1437|Were it not sinful then , striving to mend ,
1438|To mar the subject that before was well ?
1439|For to no other pass my verses tend
1440|Than of your graces and your gifts to tell ;
1441|And more , much more , than in my verse can sit ,
1442|Your own glass shows you when you look in it .
1443|To me , fair friend , you never can be old ,
1444|For as you were when first your eye I ey 'd ,
1445|Such seems your beauty still . Three winters cold ,
1446|Have from the forests shook three summers ' pride ,
1447|Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn 'd ,
1448|In process of the seasons have I seen ,
1449|Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn 'd ,
1450|Since first I saw you fresh , which yet are green .
1451|Ah ! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand ,
1452|Steal from his figure , and no pace perceiv 'd ;
1453|So your sweet hue , which methinks still doth stand ,
1454|Hath motion , and mine eye may be deceiv 'd :
1455|For fear of which , hear this thou age unbred :
1456|Ere you were born was beauty 's summer dead .
1457|Let not my love be call 'd idolatry ,
1458|Nor my beloved as an idol show ,
1459|Since all alike my songs and praises be
1460|To one , of one , still such , and ever so .
1461|Kind is my love to-day , to-morrow kind ,
1462|Still constant in a wondrous excellence ;
1463|Therefore my verse to constancy confin 'd ,
1464|One thing expressing , leaves out difference .
1465|` Fair , kind , and true , ' is all my argument ,
1466|` Fair , kind , and true , ' varying to other words ;
1467|And in this change is my invention spent ,
1468|Three themes in one , which wondrous scope affords .
1469|Fair , kind , and true , have often liv 'd alone ,
1470|Which three till now , never kept seat in one .
1471|When in the chronicle of wasted time
1472|I see descriptions of the fairest wights ,
1473|And beauty making beautiful old rime ,
1474|In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights ,
1475|Then , in the blazon of sweet beauty 's best ,
1476|Of hand , of foot , of lip , of eye , of brow ,
1477|I see their antique pen would have express 'd
1478|Even such a beauty as you master now .
1479|So all their praises are but prophecies
1480|Of this our time , all you prefiguring ;
1481|And for they looked but with divining eyes ,
1482|They had not skill enough your worth to sing :
1483|For we , which now behold these present days ,
1484|Have eyes to wonder , but lack tongues to praise .
1485|Not mine own fears , nor the prophetic soul
1486|Of the wide world dreaming on things to come ,
1487|Can yet the lease of my true love control ,
1488|Supposed as forfeit to a confin 'd doom .
1489|The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur 'd ,
1490|And the sad augurs mock their own presage ;
1491|Incertainties now crown themselves assur 'd ,
1492|And peace proclaims olives of endless age .
1493|Now with the drops of this most balmy time ,
1494|My love looks fresh , and Death to me subscribes ,
1495|Since , spite of him , I 'll live in this poor rime ,
1496|While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes :
1497|And thou in this shalt find thy monument ,
1498|When tyrants ' crests and tombs of brass are spent .
1499|What 's in the brain , that ink may character ,
1500|Which hath not figur 'd to thee my true spirit ?
1501|What 's new to speak , what now to register ,
1502|That may express my love , or thy dear merit ?
1503|Nothing , sweet boy ; but yet , like prayers divine ,
1504|I must each day say o'er the very same ;
1505|Counting no old thing old , thou mine , I thine ,
1506|Even as when first I hallow 'd thy fair name .
1507|So that eternal love in love 's fresh case ,
1508|Weighs not the dust and injury of age ,
1509|Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place ,
1510|But makes antiquity for aye his page ;
1511|Finding the first conceit of love there bred ,
1512|Where time and outward form would show it dead .
1513|O ! never say that I was false of heart ,
1514|Though absence seem 'd my flame to qualify ,
1515|As easy might I from my self depart
1516|As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie :
1517|That is my home of love : if I have rang 'd ,
1518|Like him that travels , I return again ;
1519|Just to the time , not with the time exchang 'd ,
1520|So that myself bring water for my stain .
1521|Never believe though in my nature reign 'd ,
1522|All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood ,
1523|That it could so preposterously be stain 'd ,
1524|To leave for nothing all thy sum of good ;
1525|For nothing this wide universe I call ,
1526|Save thou , my rose , in it thou art my all .
1527|Alas ! ` tis true , I have gone here and there ,
1528|And made my self a motley to the view ,
1529|Gor 'd mine own thoughts , sold cheap what is most dear ,
1530|Made old offences of affections new ;
1531|Most true it is , that I have look 'd on truth
1532|Askance and strangely ; but , by all above ,
1533|These blenches gave my heart another youth ,
1534|And worse essays prov 'd thee my best of love .
1535|Now all is done , save what shall have no end :
1536|Mine appetite I never more will grind
1537|On newer proof , to try an older friend ,
1538|A god in love , to whom I am confin 'd .
1539|Then give me welcome , next my heaven the best ,
1540|Even to thy pure and most most loving breast .
1541|O ! for my sake do you with Fortune chide ,
1542|The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds ,
1543|That did not better for my life provide
1544|Than public means which public manners breeds .
1545|Thence comes it that my name receives a brand ,
1546|And almost thence my nature is subdu 'd
1547|To what it works in , like the dyer 's hand :
1548|Pity me , then , and wish I were renew 'd ;
1549|Whilst , like a willing patient , I will drink ,
1550|Potions of eisel ` gainst my strong infection ;
1551|No bitterness that I will bitter think ,
1552|Nor double penance , to correct correction .
1553|Pity me then , dear friend , and I assure ye ,
1554|Even that your pity is enough to cure me .
1555|Your love and pity doth the impression fill ,
1556|Which vulgar scandal stamp 'd upon my brow ;
1557|For what care I who calls me well or ill ,
1558|So you o'er-green my bad , my good allow ?
1559|You are my all-the-world , and I must strive
1560|To know my shames and praises from your tongue ;
1561|None else to me , nor I to none alive ,
1562|That my steel 'd sense or changes right or wrong .
1563|In so profound abysm I throw all care
1564|Of others ' voices , that my adder 's sense
1565|To critic and to flatterer stopped are .
1566|Mark how with my neglect I do dispense :
1567|You are so strongly in my purpose bred ,
1568|That all the world besides methinks are dead .
1569|Since I left you , mine eye is in my mind ;
1570|And that which governs me to go about
1571|Doth part his function and is partly blind ,
1572|Seems seeing , but effectually is out ;
1573|For it no form delivers to the heart
1574|Of bird , of flower , or shape which it doth latch :
1575|Of his quick objects hath the mind no part ,
1576|Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch ;
1577|For if it see the rud ` st or gentlest sight ,
1578|The most sweet favour or deformed ` st creature ,
1579|The mountain or the sea , the day or night :
1580|The crow , or dove , it shapes them to your feature .
1581|Incapable of more , replete with you ,
1582|My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue .
1583|Or whether doth my mind , being crown 'd with you ,
1584|Drink up the monarch 's plague , this flattery ?
1585|Or whether shall I say , mine eye saith true ,
1586|And that your love taught it this alchemy ,
1587|To make of monsters and things indigest
1588|Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble ,
1589|Creating every bad a perfect best ,
1590|As fast as objects to his beams assemble ?
1591|O ! ` tis the first , ` tis flattery in my seeing ,
1592|And my great mind most kingly drinks it up :
1593|Mine eye well knows what with his gust is ` greeing ,
1594|And to his palate doth prepare the cup :
1595|If it be poison 'd , ` tis the lesser sin
1596|That mine eye loves it and doth first begin .
1597|Those lines that I before have writ do lie ,
1598|Even those that said I could not love you dearer :
1599|Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
1600|My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer .
1601|But reckoning Time , whose million 'd accidents
1602|Creep in ` twixt vows , and change decrees of kings ,
1603|Tan sacred beauty , blunt the sharp ` st intents ,
1604|Divert strong minds to the course of altering things ;
1605|Alas ! why fearing of Time 's tyranny ,
1606|Might I not then say , ` Now I love you best , '
1607|When I was certain o'er incertainty ,
1608|Crowning the present , doubting of the rest ?
1609|Love is a babe , then might I not say so ,
1610|To give full growth to that which still doth grow ?
1611|Let me not to the marriage of true minds
1612|Admit impediments . Love is not love
1613|Which alters when it alteration finds ,
1614|Or bends with the remover to remove :
1615|O , no ! it is an ever-fixed mark ,
1616|That looks on tempests and is never shaken ;
1617|It is the star to every wandering bark ,
1618|Whose worth 's unknown , although his height be taken .
1619|Love 's not Time 's fool , though rosy lips and cheeks
1620|Within his bending sickle 's compass come ;
1621|Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks ,
1622|But bears it out even to the edge of doom .
1623|If this be error and upon me prov 'd ,
1624|I never writ , nor no man ever lov 'd .
1625|Accuse me thus : that I have scanted all ,
1626|Wherein I should your great deserts repay ,
1627|Forgot upon your dearest love to call ,
1628|Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day ;
1629|That I have frequent been with unknown minds ,
1630|And given to time your own dear-purchas 'd right ;
1631|That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
1632|Which should transport me farthest from your sight .
1633|Book both my wilfulness and errors down ,
1634|And on just proof surmise , accumulate ;
1635|Bring me within the level of your frown ,
1636|But shoot not at me in your waken 'd hate ;
1637|Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
1638|The constancy and virtue of your love .
1639|Like as , to make our appetite more keen ,
1640|With eager compounds we our palate urge ;
1641|As , to prevent our maladies unseen ,
1642|We sicken to shun sickness when we purge ;
1643|Even so , being full of your ne'er - cloying sweetness ,
1644|To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding ;
1645|And , sick of welfare , found a kind of meetness
1646|To be diseas 'd , ere that there was true needing .
1647|Thus policy in love , to anticipate
1648|The ills that were not , grew to faults assur 'd ,
1649|And brought to medicine a healthful state
1650|Which , rank of goodness , would by ill be cur 'd ;
1651|But thence I learn and find the lesson true ,
1652|Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you .
1653|What potions have I drunk of Siren tears ,
1654|Distill 'd from limbecks foul as hell within ,
1655|Applying fears to hopes , and hopes to fears ,
1656|Still losing when I saw myself to win !
1657|What wretched errors hath my heart committed ,
1658|Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never !
1659|How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted ,
1660|In the distraction of this madding fever !
1661|O benefit of ill ! now I find true
1662|That better is , by evil still made better ;
1663|And ruin 'd love , when it is built anew ,
1664|Grows fairer than at first , more strong , far greater .
1665|So I return rebuk 'd to my content ,
1666|And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent .
1667|That you were once unkind befriends me now ,
1668|And for that sorrow , which I then did feel ,
1669|Needs must I under my transgression bow ,
1670|Unless my nerves were brass or hammer 'd steel .
1671|For if you were by my unkindness shaken ,
1672|As I by yours , you 've pass 'd a hell of time ;
1673|And I , a tyrant , have no leisure taken
1674|To weigh how once I suffer 'd in your crime .
1675|O ! that our night of woe might have remember 'd
1676|My deepest sense , how hard true sorrow hits ,
1677|And soon to you , as you to me , then tender 'd
1678|The humble salve , which wounded bosoms fits !
1679|But that your trespass now becomes a fee ;
1680|Mine ransoms yours , and yours must ransom me .
1681|` Tis better to be vile than vile esteem 'd ,
1682|When not to be receives reproach of being ;
1683|And the just pleasure lost , which is so deem 'd
1684|Not by our feeling , but by others ' seeing :
1685|For why should others ' false adulterate eyes
1686|Give salutation to my sportive blood ?
1687|Or on my frailties why are frailer spies ,
1688|Which in their wills count bad what I think good ?
1689|No , I am that I am , and they that level
1690|At my abuses reckon up their own :
1691|I may be straight though they themselves be bevel ;
1692|By their rank thoughts , my deeds must not be shown ;
1693|Unless this general evil they maintain ,
1694|All men are bad and in their badness reign .
1695|Thy gift , thy tables , are within my brain
1696|Full character 'd with lasting memory ,
1697|Which shall above that idle rank remain ,
1698|Beyond all date ; even to eternity :
1699|Or , at the least , so long as brain and heart
1700|Have faculty by nature to subsist ;
1701|Till each to raz 'd oblivion yield his part
1702|Of thee , thy record never can be miss 'd .
1703|That poor retention could not so much hold ,
1704|Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score ;
1705|Therefore to give them from me was I bold ,
1706|To trust those tables that receive thee more :
1707|To keep an adjunct to remember thee
1708|Were to import forgetfulness in me .
1709|No , Time , thou shalt not boast that I do change :
1710|Thy pyramids built up with newer might
1711|To me are nothing novel , nothing strange ;
1712|They are but dressings of a former sight .
1713|Our dates are brief , and therefore we admire
1714|What thou dost foist upon us that is old ;
1715|And rather make them born to our desire
1716|Than think that we before have heard them told .
1717|Thy registers and thee I both defy ,
1718|Not wondering at the present nor the past ,
1719|For thy records and what we see doth lie ,
1720|Made more or less by thy continual haste .
1721|This I do vow and this shall ever be ;
1722|I will be true despite thy scythe and thee .
1723|If my dear love were but the child of state ,
1724|It might for Fortune 's bastard be unfather 'd ,
1725|As subject to Time 's love or to Time 's hate ,
1726|Weeds among weeds , or flowers with flowers gather 'd .
1727|No , it was builded far from accident ;
1728|It suffers not in smiling pomp , nor falls
1729|Under the blow of thralled discontent ,
1730|Whereto th ' inviting time our fashion calls :
1731|It fears not policy , that heretic ,
1732|Which works on leases of short-number 'd hours ,
1733|But all alone stands hugely politic ,
1734|That it nor grows with heat , nor drowns with showers .
1735|To this I witness call the fools of time ,
1736|Which die for goodness , who have lived for crime .
1737|Were ' t aught to me I bore the canopy ,
1738|With my extern the outward honouring ,
1739|Or laid great bases for eternity ,
1740|Which proves more short than waste or ruining ?
1741|Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
1742|Lose all and more by paying too much rent
1743|For compound sweet ; forgoing simple savour ,
1744|Pitiful thrivers , in their gazing spent ?
1745|No ; let me be obsequious in thy heart ,
1746|And take thou my oblation , poor but free ,
1747|Which is not mix 'd with seconds , knows no art ,
1748|But mutual render , only me for thee .
1749|Hence , thou suborned informer ! a true soul
1750|When most impeach 'd , stands least in thy control .
1751|O thou , my lovely boy , who in thy power
1752|Dost hold Time 's fickle glass , his fickle hour ;
1753|Who hast by waning grown , and therein show ` st
1754|Thy lovers withering , as thy sweet self grow ` st.
1755|If Nature , sovereign mistress over wrack ,
1756|As thou goest onwards , still will pluck thee back ,
1757|She keeps thee to this purpose , that her skill
1758|May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill .
1759|Yet fear her , O thou minion of her pleasure !
1760|She may detain , but not still keep , her treasure :
1761|Her audit -LRB- though delayed -RRB- answered must be ,
1762|And her quietus is to render thee .
1763|In the old age black was not counted fair ,
1764|Or if it were , it bore not beauty 's name ;
1765|But now is black beauty 's successive heir ,
1766|And beauty slander 'd with a bastard shame :
1767|For since each hand hath put on Nature 's power ,
1768|Fairing the foul with Art 's false borrowed face ,
1769|Sweet beauty hath no name , no holy bower ,
1770|But is profan 'd , if not lives in disgrace .
1771|Therefore my mistress ' eyes are raven black ,
1772|Her eyes so suited , and they mourners seem
1773|At such who , not born fair , no beauty lack ,
1774|Sland ` ring creation with a false esteem :
1775|Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe ,
1776|That every tongue says beauty should look so .
1777|How oft when thou , my music , music play ` st ,
1778|Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
1779|With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway ` st
1780|The wiry concord that mine ear confounds ,
1781|Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap ,
1782|To kiss the tender inward of thy hand ,
1783|Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap ,
1784|At the wood 's boldness by thee blushing stand !
1785|To be so tickled , they would change their state
1786|And situation with those dancing chips ,
1787|O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait ,
1788|Making dead wood more bless 'd than living lips .
1789|Since saucy jacks so happy are in this ,
1790|Give them thy fingers , me thy lips to kiss .
1791|The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
1792|Is lust in action : and till action , lust
1793|Is perjur 'd , murderous , bloody , full of blame ,
1794|Savage , extreme , rude , cruel , not to trust ;
1795|Enjoy 'd no sooner but despised straight ;
1796|Past reason hunted ; and no sooner had ,
1797|Past reason hated , as a swallow 'd bait ,
1798|On purpose laid to make the taker mad :
1799|Mad in pursuit and in possession so ;
1800|Had , having , and in quest , to have extreme ;
1801|A bliss in proof , -- and prov 'd , a very woe ;
1802|Before , a joy propos 'd ; behind a dream .
1803|All this the world well knows ; yet none knows well
1804|To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell .
1805|My mistress ' eyes are nothing like the sun ;
1806|Coral is far more red , than her lips red :
1807|If snow be white , why then her breasts are dun ;
1808|If hairs be wires , black wires grow on her head .
1809|I have seen roses damask 'd , red and white ,
1810|But no such roses see I in her cheeks ;
1811|And in some perfumes is there more delight
1812|Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks .
1813|I love to hear her speak , yet well I know
1814|That music hath a far more pleasing sound :
1815|I grant I never saw a goddess go , --
1816|My mistress , when she walks , treads on the ground :
1817|And yet by heaven , I think my love as rare ,
1818|As any she belied with false compare .
1819|Thou art as tyrannous , so as thou art ,
1820|As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel ;
1821|For well thou know ` st to my dear doting heart
1822|Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel .
1823|Yet , in good faith , some say that thee behold ,
1824|Thy face hath not the power to make love groan ;
1825|To say they err I dare not be so bold ,
1826|Although I swear it to myself alone .
1827|And to be sure that is not false I swear ,
1828|A thousand groans , but thinking on thy face ,
1829|One on another 's neck , do witness bear
1830|Thy black is fairest in my judgment 's place .
1831|In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds ,
1832|And thence this slander , as I think , proceeds .
1833|Thine eyes I love , and they , as pitying me ,
1834|Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain ,
1835|Have put on black and loving mourners be ,
1836|Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain .
1837|And truly not the morning sun of heaven
1838|Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east ,
1839|Nor that full star that ushers in the even ,
1840|Doth half that glory to the sober west ,
1841|As those two mourning eyes become thy face :
1842|O ! let it then as well beseem thy heart
1843|To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace ,
1844|And suit thy pity like in every part .
1845|Then will I swear beauty herself is black ,
1846|And all they foul that thy complexion lack .
1847|Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
1848|For that deep wound it gives my friend and me !
1849|Is ' t not enough to torture me alone ,
1850|But slave to slavery my sweet ` st friend must be ?
1851|Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken ,
1852|And my next self thou harder hast engross 'd :
1853|Of him , myself , and thee I am forsaken ;
1854|A torment thrice three-fold thus to be cross 'd :
1855|Prison my heart in thy steel bosom 's ward ,
1856|But then my friend 's heart let my poor heart bail ;
1857|Whoe'er keeps me , let my heart be his guard ;
1858|Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail :
1859|And yet thou wilt ; for I , being pent in thee ,
1860|Perforce am thine , and all that is in me .
1861|So , now I have confess 'd that he is thine ,
1862|And I my self am mortgag 'd to thy will ,
1863|Myself I 'll forfeit , so that other mine
1864|Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still :
1865|But thou wilt not , nor he will not be free ,
1866|For thou art covetous , and he is kind ;
1867|He learn 'd but surety-like to write for me ,
1868|Under that bond that him as fast doth bind .
1869|The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take ,
1870|Thou usurer , that putt ` st forth all to use ,
1871|And sue a friend came debtor for my sake ;
1872|So him I lose through my unkind abuse .
1873|Him have I lost ; thou hast both him and me :
1874|He pays the whole , and yet am I not free .
1875|Whoever hath her wish , thou hast thy ` Will , '
1876|And ` Will ' to boot , and ` Will ' in over-plus ;
1877|More than enough am I that vex 'd thee still ,
1878|To thy sweet will making addition thus .
1879|Wilt thou , whose will is large and spacious ,
1880|Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine ?
1881|Shall will in others seem right gracious ,
1882|And in my will no fair acceptance shine ?
1883|The sea , all water , yet receives rain still ,
1884|And in abundance addeth to his store ;
1885|So thou , being rich in ` Will , ' add to thy ` Will '
1886|One will of mine , to make thy large will more .
1887|Let no unkind ` No ' fair beseechers kill ;
1888|Think all but one , and me in that one ` Will . '
1889|If thy soul check thee that I come so near ,
1890|Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy ` Will ' ,
1891|And will , thy soul knows , is admitted there ;
1892|Thus far for love , my love-suit , sweet , fulfil .
1893|` Will ' , will fulfil the treasure of thy love ,
1894|Ay , fill it full with wills , and my will one .
1895|In things of great receipt with ease we prove
1896|Among a number one is reckon 'd none :
1897|Then in the number let me pass untold ,
1898|Though in thy store 's account I one must be ;
1899|For nothing hold me , so it please thee hold
1900|That nothing me , a something sweet to thee :
1901|Make but my name thy love , and love that still ,
1902|And then thou lov ` st me for my name is ` Will . '
1903|Thou blind fool , Love , what dost thou to mine eyes ,
1904|That they behold , and see not what they see ?
1905|They know what beauty is , see where it lies ,
1906|Yet what the best is take the worst to be .
1907|If eyes , corrupt by over-partial looks ,
1908|Be anchor 'd in the bay where all men ride ,
1909|Why of eyes ' falsehood hast thou forged hooks ,
1910|Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied ?
1911|Why should my heart think that a several plot ,
1912|Which my heart knows the wide world 's common place ?
1913|Or mine eyes , seeing this , say this is not ,
1914|To put fair truth upon so foul a face ?
1915|In things right true my heart and eyes have err 'd ,
1916|And to this false plague are they now transferr 'd .
1917|When my love swears that she is made of truth ,
1918|I do believe her though I know she lies ,
1919|That she might think me some untutor 'd youth ,
1920|Unlearned in the world 's false subtleties .
1921|Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young ,
1922|Although she knows my days are past the best ,
1923|Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue :
1924|On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed :
1925|But wherefore says she not she is unjust ?
1926|And wherefore say not I that I am old ?
1927|O ! love 's best habit is in seeming trust ,
1928|And age in love , loves not to have years told :
1929|Therefore I lie with her , and she with me ,
1930|And in our faults by lies we flatter 'd be .
1931|O ! call not me to justify the wrong
1932|That thy unkindness lays upon my heart ;
1933|Wound me not with thine eye , but with thy tongue :
1934|Use power with power , and slay me not by art ,
1935|Tell me thou lov ` st elsewhere ; but in my sight ,
1936|Dear heart , forbear to glance thine eye aside :
1937|What need ` st thou wound with cunning , when thy might
1938|Is more than my o'erpress 'd defence can bide ?
1939|Let me excuse thee : ah ! my love well knows
1940|Her pretty looks have been mine enemies ;
1941|And therefore from my face she turns my foes ,
1942|That they elsewhere might dart their injuries :
1943|Yet do not so ; but since I am near slain ,
1944|Kill me outright with looks , and rid my pain .
1945|Be wise as thou art cruel ; do not press
1946|My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain ;
1947|Lest sorrow lend me words , and words express
1948|The manner of my pity-wanting pain .
1949|If I might teach thee wit , better it were ,
1950|Though not to love , yet , love to tell me so ; --
1951|As testy sick men , when their deaths be near ,
1952|No news but health from their physicians know ; --
1953|For , if I should despair , I should grow mad ,
1954|And in my madness might speak ill of thee ;
1955|Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad ,
1956|Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be .
1957|That I may not be so , nor thou belied ,
1958|Bear thine eyes straight , though thy proud heart go wide .
1959|In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes ,
1960|For they in thee a thousand errors note ;
1961|But ` tis my heart that loves what they despise ,
1962|Who , in despite of view , is pleased to dote .
1963|Nor are mine ears with thy tongue 's tune delighted ;
1964|Nor tender feeling , to base touches prone ,
1965|Nor taste , nor smell , desire to be invited
1966|To any sensual feast with thee alone :
1967|But my five wits nor my five senses can
1968|Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee ,
1969|Who leaves unsway 'd the likeness of a man ,
1970|Thy proud heart 's slave and vassal wretch to be :
1971|Only my plague thus far I count my gain ,
1972|That she that makes me sin awards me pain .
1973|Love is my sin , and thy dear virtue hate ,
1974|Hate of my sin , grounded on sinful loving :
1975|O ! but with mine compare thou thine own state ,
1976|And thou shalt find it merits not reproving ;
1977|Or , if it do , not from those lips of thine ,
1978|That have profan 'd their scarlet ornaments
1979|And seal 'd false bonds of love as oft as mine ,
1980|Robb 'd others ' beds ' revenues of their rents .
1981|Be it lawful I love thee , as thou lov ` st those
1982|Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee :
1983|Root pity in thy heart , that , when it grows ,
1984|Thy pity may deserve to pitied be .
1985|If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide ,
1986|By self-example mayst thou be denied !
1987|Lo , as a careful housewife runs to catch
1988|One of her feather 'd creatures broke away ,
1989|Sets down her babe , and makes all swift dispatch
1990|In pursuit of the thing she would have stay ;
1991|Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase ,
1992|Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
1993|To follow that which flies before her face ,
1994|Not prizing her poor infant 's discontent ;
1995|So runn ` st thou after that which flies from thee ,
1996|Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind ;
1997|But if thou catch thy hope , turn back to me ,
1998|And play the mother 's part , kiss me , be kind ;
1999|So will I pray that thou mayst have thy ` Will , '
2000|If thou turn back and my loud crying still .
2001|Two loves I have of comfort and despair ,
2002|Which like two spirits do suggest me still :
2003|The better angel is a man right fair ,
2004|The worser spirit a woman colour 'd ill .
2005|To win me soon to hell , my female evil ,
2006|Tempteth my better angel from my side ,
2007|And would corrupt my saint to be a devil ,
2008|Wooing his purity with her foul pride .
2009|And whether that my angel be turn 'd fiend ,
2010|Suspect I may , yet not directly tell ;
2011|But being both from me , both to each friend ,
2012|I guess one angel in another 's hell :
2013|Yet this shall I ne'er know , but live in doubt ,
2014|Till my bad angel fire my good one out .
2015|Those lips that Love 's own hand did make ,
2016|Breathed forth the sound that said ' I hate ' ,
2017|To me that languish 'd for her sake :
2018|But when she saw my woeful state ,
2019|Straight in her heart did mercy come ,
2020|Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
2021|Was us 'd in giving gentle doom ;
2022|And taught it thus anew to greet ;
2023|' I hate ' she alter 'd with an end ,
2024|That followed it as gentle day ,
2025|Doth follow night , who like a fiend
2026|From heaven to hell is flown away .
2027|' I hate ' , from hate away she threw ,
2028|And sav 'd my life , saying ` not you ' .
2029|Poor soul , the centre of my sinful earth ,
2030|My sinful earth these rebel powers array ,
2031|Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth ,
2032|Painting thy outward walls so costly gay ?
2033|Why so large cost , having so short a lease ,
2034|Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend ?
2035|Shall worms , inheritors of this excess ,
2036|Eat up thy charge ? Is this thy body 's end ?
2037|Then soul , live thou upon thy servant 's loss ,
2038|And let that pine to aggravate thy store ;
2039|Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross ;
2040|Within be fed , without be rich no more :
2041|So shall thou feed on Death , that feeds on men ,
2042|And Death once dead , there 's no more dying then .
2043|My love is as a fever longing still ,
2044|For that which longer nurseth the disease ;
2045|Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill ,
2046|The uncertain sickly appetite to please .
2047|My reason , the physician to my love ,
2048|Angry that his prescriptions are not kept ,
2049|Hath left me , and I desperate now approve
2050|Desire is death , which physic did except .
2051|Past cure I am , now Reason is past care ,
2052|And frantic-mad with evermore unrest ;
2053|My thoughts and my discourse as madmen 's are ,
2054|At random from the truth vainly express 'd ;
2055|For I have sworn thee fair , and thought thee bright ,
2056|Who art as black as hell , as dark as night .
2057|O me ! what eyes hath Love put in my head ,
2058|Which have no correspondence with true sight ;
2059|Or , if they have , where is my judgment fled ,
2060|That censures falsely what they see aright ?
2061|If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote ,
2062|What means the world to say it is not so ?
2063|If it be not , then love doth well denote
2064|Love 's eye is not so true as all men 's : no ,
2065|How can it ? O ! how can Love 's eye be true ,
2066|That is so vexed with watching and with tears ?
2067|No marvel then , though I mistake my view ;
2068|The sun itself sees not , till heaven clears .
2069|O cunning Love ! with tears thou keep ` st me blind ,
2070|Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find .
2071|Canst thou , O cruel ! say I love thee not ,
2072|When I against myself with thee partake ?
2073|Do I not think on thee , when I forgot
2074|Am of my self , all tyrant , for thy sake ?
2075|Who hateth thee that I do call my friend ,
2076|On whom frown ` st thou that I do fawn upon ,
2077|Nay , if thou lour ` st on me , do I not spend
2078|Revenge upon myself with present moan ?
2079|What merit do I in my self respect ,
2080|That is so proud thy service to despise ,
2081|When all my best doth worship thy defect ,
2082|Commanded by the motion of thine eyes ?
2083|But , love , hate on , for now I know thy mind ;
2084|Those that can see thou lov ` st , and I am blind .
2085|O ! from what power hast thou this powerful might ,
2086|With insufficiency my heart to sway ?
2087|To make me give the lie to my true sight ,
2088|And swear that brightness doth not grace the day ?
2089|Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill ,
2090|That in the very refuse of thy deeds
2091|There is such strength and warrantise of skill ,
2092|That , in my mind , thy worst all best exceeds ?
2093|Who taught thee how to make me love thee more ,
2094|The more I hear and see just cause of hate ?
2095|O ! though I love what others do abhor ,
2096|With others thou shouldst not abhor my state :
2097|If thy unworthiness rais 'd love in me ,
2098|More worthy I to be belov 'd of thee .
2099|Love is too young to know what conscience is ,
2100|Yet who knows not conscience is born of love ?
2101|Then , gentle cheater , urge not my amiss ,
2102|Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove :
2103|For , thou betraying me , I do betray
2104|My nobler part to my gross body 's treason ;
2105|My soul doth tell my body that he may
2106|Triumph in love ; flesh stays no farther reason ,
2107|But rising at thy name doth point out thee ,
2108|As his triumphant prize . Proud of this pride ,
2109|He is contented thy poor drudge to be ,
2110|To stand in thy affairs , fall by thy side .
2111|No want of conscience hold it that I call
2112|Her ` love , ' for whose dear love I rise and fall .
2113|In loving thee thou know ` st I am forsworn ,
2114|But thou art twice forsworn , to me love swearing ;
2115|In act thy bed-vow broke , and new faith torn ,
2116|In vowing new hate after new love bearing :
2117|But why of two oaths ' breach do I accuse thee ,
2118|When I break twenty ? I am perjur 'd most ;
2119|For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee ,
2120|And all my honest faith in thee is lost :
2121|For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness ,
2122|Oaths of thy love , thy truth , thy constancy ;
2123|And , to enlighten thee , gave eyes to blindness ,
2124|Or made them swear against the thing they see ;
2125|For I have sworn thee fair ; more perjur 'd I ,
2126|To swear against the truth so foul a lie !
2127|Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep :
2128|A maid of Dian 's this advantage found ,
2129|And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
2130|In a cold valley-fountain of that ground ;
2131|Which borrow 'd from this holy fire of Love ,
2132|A dateless lively heat , still to endure ,
2133|And grew a seeting bath , which yet men prove
2134|Against strange maladies a sovereign cure .
2135|But at my mistress ' eye Love 's brand new-fired ,
2136|The boy for trial needs would touch my breast ;
2137|I , sick withal , the help of bath desired ,
2138|And thither hied , a sad distemper 'd guest ,
2139|But found no cure , the bath for my help lies
2140|Where Cupid got new fire ; my mistress ' eyes .
2141|The little Love-god lying once asleep ,
2142|Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand ,
2143|Whilst many nymphs that vow 'd chaste life to keep
2144|Came tripping by ; but in her maiden hand
2145|The fairest votary took up that fire
2146|Which many legions of true hearts had warm 'd ;
2147|And so the general of hot desire
2148|Was , sleeping , by a virgin hand disarm 'd .
2149|This brand she quenched in a cool well by ,
2150|Which from Love 's fire took heat perpetual ,
2151|Growing a bath and healthful remedy ,
2152|For men diseas 'd ; but I , my mistress ' thrall ,
2153|Came there for cure and this by that I prove ,
2154|Love 's fire heats water , water cools not love .
