there once was a woman enjoying her life in Lamar
who had men in a car
I took up one tune
of a new Moon
and was in a th bar

there was an enthusiastic man that lived in Dakar
who saw things from another star
I found out one afternoon
that the dark moon
and lost in the dark scar

there once was an enthusiastic woman named Romaine
who told stories about the pain
she felt off one kind
of a high wind
and fell off a high plane

there once was an enthusiastic man named Case
who did wonders for the birthplace
I got a report
from a local court
and asked for a special grace

there once was an enthusiastic woman named Germaine
who laid eggs on a grain
I came up one mind
in a un kind
and lay in a u vein

there once was an enthusiastic woman named Germaine
who wrote books in every domain
she experienced off one mankind
in any great whirlwind
and fell in a great rain

there was an enthusiastic man that lived in Moraine
who collected funds for this campaign
he operated out two whirlwind
for any good mankind
and was on the same plane
