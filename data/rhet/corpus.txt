0,From fairest creatures we desire increase ,
1,That thereby beauty 's rose might never die ,
2,But as the riper should by time decease ,
3,His tender heir might bear his memory :
4,But thou ,
5,contracted to thine own bright eyes ,
6,Feed ` st thy light 's flame with self-substantial fuel ,
7,Making a famine where abundance lies ,
8,Thy self thy foe ,
9,to thy sweet self too cruel :
10,Thou that art now the world 's fresh ornament ,
11,And only herald to the gaudy spring ,
12,Within thine own bud buriest thy content ,
13,And tender churl mak ` st waste in niggarding :
14,Pity the world ,
15,or else this glutton be ,
16,To eat the world 's due ,
17,by the grave and thee .
18,II When forty winters shall besiege thy brow ,
19,And dig deep trenches in thy beauty 's field ,
20,Thy youth 's proud livery so gazed on now ,
21,Will be a tatter 'd weed of small worth held :
22,Then being asked ,
23,where all thy beauty lies ,
24,Where all the treasure of thy lusty days ;
25,To say ,
26,within thine own deep sunken eyes ,
27,Were an all-eating shame ,
28,and thriftless praise .
29,How much more praise deserv 'd thy beauty 's use ,
30,If thou couldst answer ` This fair child of mine Shall sum my count ,
31,and make my old excuse , '
32,Proving his beauty by succession thine !
33,This were to be new made when thou art old ,
34,And see thy blood warm when thou feel ` st it cold .
35,III Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest Now is the time that face should form another ;
36,Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest ,
37,Thou dost beguile the world ,
38,unbless some mother .
39,For where is she so fair whose unear 'd womb Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry ?
40,Or who is he so fond will be the tomb ,
41,Of his self-love to stop posterity ?
42,Thou art thy mother 's glass and she in thee Calls back the lovely April of her prime ;
43,So thou through windows of thine age shalt see ,
44,Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time .
45,But if thou live ,
46,remember 'd not to be ,
47,Die single and thine image dies with thee .
48,IV Unthrifty loveliness ,
49,why dost thou spend Upon thy self thy beauty 's legacy ?
50,Nature 's bequest gives nothing ,
51,but doth lend ,
52,And being frank she lends to those are free :
53,Then ,
54,beauteous niggard ,
55,why dost thou abuse The bounteous largess given thee to give ?
56,Profitless usurer ,
57,why dost thou use So great a sum of sums ,
58,yet canst not live ?
59,For having traffic with thy self alone ,
60,Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive :
61,Then how when nature calls thee to be gone ,
62,What acceptable audit canst thou leave ?
63,Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee ,
64,Which ,
65,used ,
66,lives th ' executor to be .
67,V Those hours ,
68,that with gentle work did frame The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell ,
69,Will play the tyrants to the very same And that unfair which fairly doth excel ;
70,For never-resting time leads summer on To hideous winter ,
71,and confounds him there ;
72,Sap checked with frost ,
73,and lusty leaves quite gone ,
74,Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where :
75,Then were not summer 's distillation left ,
76,A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass ,
77,Beauty 's effect with beauty were bereft ,
78,Nor it ,
79,nor no remembrance what it was :
80,But flowers distill 'd ,
81,though they with winter meet ,
82,Leese but their show ;
83,their substance still lives sweet .
84,VI Then let not winter 's ragged hand deface ,
85,In thee thy summer ,
86,ere thou be distill 'd :
87,Make sweet some vial ;
88,treasure thou some place With beauty 's treasure ere it be self-kill 'd .
89,That use is not forbidden usury ,
90,Which happies those that pay the willing loan ;
91,That 's for thy self to breed another thee ,
92,Or ten times happier ,
93,be it ten for one ;
94,Ten times thy self were happier than thou art ,
95,If ten of thine ten times refigur 'd thee :
96,Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart ,
97,Leaving thee living in posterity ?
98,Be not self-will 'd ,
99,for thou art much too fair To be death 's conquest and make worms thine heir .
100,VII Lo !
101,in the orient when the gracious light Lifts up his burning head ,
102,each under eye Doth homage to his new-appearing sight ,
103,Serving with looks his sacred majesty ;
104,And having climb 'd the steep-up heavenly hill ,
105,Resembling strong youth in his middle age ,
106,Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still ,
107,Attending on his golden pilgrimage :
108,But when from highmost pitch ,
109,with weary car ,
110,Like feeble age ,
111,he reeleth from the day ,
112,The eyes ,
113,` fore duteous ,
114,now converted are From his low tract ,
115,and look another way :
116,So thou ,
117,thyself outgoing in thy noon :
118,Unlook 'd ,
119,on diest unless thou get a son .
120,VIII Music to hear ,
121,why hear ` st thou music sadly ?
122,Sweets with sweets war not ,
123,joy delights in joy :
124,Why lov ` st thou that which thou receiv ` st not gladly ,
125,Or else receiv ` st with pleasure thine annoy ?
126,If the true concord of well-tuned sounds ,
127,By unions married ,
128,do offend thine ear ,
129,They do but sweetly chide thee ,
130,who confounds In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear .
131,Mark how one string ,
132,sweet husband to another ,
133,Strikes each in each by mutual ordering ;
134,Resembling sire and child and happy mother ,
135,Who ,
136,all in one ,
137,one pleasing note do sing :
138,Whose speechless song being many ,
139,seeming one ,
140,Sings this to thee :
141,` Thou single wilt prove none . '
142,IX Is it for fear to wet a widow 's eye ,
143,That thou consum ` st thy self in single life ?
144,Ah !
145,if thou issueless shalt hap to die ,
146,The world will wail thee like a makeless wife ;
147,The world will be thy widow and still weep That thou no form of thee hast left behind ,
148,When every private widow well may keep By children 's eyes ,
149,her husband 's shape in mind :
150,Look !
151,what an unthrift in the world doth spend Shifts but his place ,
152,for still the world enjoys it ;
153,But beauty 's waste hath in the world an end ,
154,And kept unused the user so destroys it .
155,No love toward others in that bosom sits That on himself such murd ` rous shame commits .
156,X For shame !
157,deny that thou bear ` st love to any ,
158,Who for thy self art so unprovident .
159,Grant ,
160,if thou wilt ,
161,thou art belov 'd of many ,
162,But that thou none lov ` st is most evident :
163,For thou art so possess 'd with murderous hate ,
164,That ` gainst thy self thou stick ` st not to conspire ,
165,Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate Which to repair should be thy chief desire .
166,O !
167,change thy thought ,
168,that I may change my mind :
169,Shall hate be fairer lodg 'd than gentle love ?
170,Be ,
171,as thy presence is ,
172,gracious and kind ,
173,Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove :
174,Make thee another self for love of me ,
175,That beauty still may live in thine or thee .
176,XI As fast as thou shalt wane ,
177,so fast thou grow ` st ,
178,In one of thine ,
179,from that which thou departest ;
180,And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow ` st ,
181,Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest ,
182,Herein lives wisdom ,
183,beauty ,
184,and increase ;
185,Without this folly ,
186,age ,
187,and cold decay :
188,If all were minded so ,
189,the times should cease And threescore year would make the world away .
190,Let those whom nature hath not made for store ,
191,Harsh ,
192,featureless ,
193,and rude ,
194,barrenly perish :
195,Look ,
196,whom she best endow 'd ,
197,she gave thee more ;
198,Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish :
199,She carv 'd thee for her seal ,
200,and meant thereby ,
201,Thou shouldst print more ,
202,not let that copy die .
203,XII When I do count the clock that tells the time ,
204,And see the brave day sunk in hideous night ;
205,When I behold the violet past prime ,
206,And sable curls ,
207,all silvered o'er with white ;
208,When lofty trees I see barren of leaves ,
209,Which erst from heat did canopy the herd ,
210,And summer 's green all girded up in sheaves ,
211,Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard ,
212,Then of thy beauty do I question make ,
213,That thou among the wastes of time must go ,
214,Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake And die as fast as they see others grow ;
215,And nothing ` gainst Time 's scythe can make defence Save breed ,
216,to brave him when he takes thee hence .
217,XIII O !
218,that you were your self ;
219,but ,
220,love you are No longer yours ,
221,than you your self here live :
222,Against this coming end you should prepare ,
223,And your sweet semblance to some other give :
224,So should that beauty which you hold in lease Find no determination ;
225,then you were Yourself again ,
226,after yourself 's decease ,
227,When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear .
228,Who lets so fair a house fall to decay ,
229,Which husbandry in honour might uphold ,
230,Against the stormy gusts of winter 's day And barren rage of death 's eternal cold ?
231,O !
232,none but unthrifts .
233,Dear my love ,
234,you know ,
235,You had a father :
236,let your son say so .
237,XIV Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck ;
238,And yet methinks I have astronomy ,
239,But not to tell of good or evil luck ,
240,Of plagues ,
241,of dearths ,
242,or seasons ' quality ;
243,Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell ,
244,Pointing to each his thunder ,
245,rain and wind ,
246,Or say with princes if it shall go well By oft predict that I in heaven find :
247,But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive ,
248,And constant stars in them I read such art As ` Truth and beauty shall together thrive ,
249,If from thyself ,
250,to store thou wouldst convert ' ;
251,Or else of thee this I prognosticate :
252,` Thy end is truth 's and beauty 's doom and date . '
253,XV When I consider every thing that grows Holds in perfection but a little moment ,
254,That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows Whereon the stars in secret influence comment ;
255,When I perceive that men as plants increase ,
256,Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky ,
257,Vaunt in their youthful sap ,
258,at height decrease ,
259,And wear their brave state out of memory ;
260,Then the conceit of this inconstant stay Sets you most rich in youth before my sight ,
261,Where wasteful Time debateth with decay To change your day of youth to sullied night ,
262,And all in war with Time for love of you ,
263,As he takes from you ,
264,I engraft you new .
265,XVI But wherefore do not you a mightier way Make war upon this bloody tyrant ,
266,Time ?
267,And fortify your self in your decay With means more blessed than my barren rhyme ?
268,Now stand you on the top of happy hours ,
269,And many maiden gardens ,
270,yet unset ,
271,With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers ,
272,Much liker than your painted counterfeit :
273,So should the lines of life that life repair ,
274,Which this ,
275,Time 's pencil ,
276,or my pupil pen ,
277,Neither in inward worth nor outward fair ,
278,Can make you live your self in eyes of men .
279,To give away yourself ,
280,keeps yourself still ,
281,And you must live ,
282,drawn by your own sweet skill .
283,XVII Who will believe my verse in time to come ,
284,If it were fill 'd with your most high deserts ?
285,Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb Which hides your life ,
286,and shows not half your parts .
287,If I could write the beauty of your eyes ,
288,And in fresh numbers number all your graces ,
289,The age to come would say ` This poet lies ;
290,Such heavenly touches ne'er touch 'd earthly faces . '
291,So should my papers ,
292,yellow 'd with their age ,
293,Be scorn 'd ,
294,like old men of less truth than tongue ,
295,And your true rights be term 'd a poet 's rage And stretched metre of an antique song :
296,But were some child of yours alive that time ,
297,You should live twice ,
298,-- in it ,
299,and in my rhyme .
300,XVIII Shall I compare thee to a summer 's day ?
301,Thou art more lovely and more temperate :
302,Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May ,
303,And summer 's lease hath all too short a date :
304,Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines ,
305,And often is his gold complexion dimm 'd ,
306,And every fair from fair sometime declines ,
307,By chance ,
308,or nature 's changing course untrimm 'd :
309,But thy eternal summer shall not fade ,
310,Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow ` st ,
311,Nor shall death brag thou wander ` st in his shade ,
312,When in eternal lines to time thou grow ` st ,
313,So long as men can breathe ,
314,or eyes can see ,
315,So long lives this ,
316,and this gives life to thee .
317,XIX Devouring Time ,
318,blunt thou the lion 's paws ,
319,And make the earth devour her own sweet brood ;
320,Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger 's jaws ,
321,And burn the long-liv 'd phoenix ,
322,in her blood ;
323,Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets ,
324,And do whate'er thou wilt ,
325,swift-footed Time ,
326,To the wide world and all her fading sweets ;
327,But I forbid thee one most heinous crime :
328,O !
329,carve not with thy hours my love 's fair brow ,
330,Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen ;
331,Him in thy course untainted do allow For beauty 's pattern to succeeding men .
332,Yet ,
333,do thy worst old Time :
334,despite thy wrong ,
335,My love shall in my verse ever live young .
336,XX A woman 's face with nature 's own hand painted ,
337,Hast thou ,
338,the master mistress of my passion ;
339,A woman 's gentle heart ,
340,but not acquainted With shifting change ,
341,as is false women 's fashion :
342,An eye more bright than theirs ,
343,less false in rolling ,
344,Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth ;
345,A man in hue all ` hues ' in his controlling ,
346,Which steals men 's eyes and women 's souls amazeth .
347,And for a woman wert thou first created ;
348,Till Nature ,
349,as she wrought thee ,
350,fell a-doting ,
351,And by addition me of thee defeated ,
352,By adding one thing to my purpose nothing .
353,But since she prick 'd thee out for women 's pleasure ,
354,Mine be thy love and thy love 's use their treasure .
355,XXI So is it not with me as with that Muse ,
356,Stirr 'd by a painted beauty to his verse ,
357,Who heaven itself for ornament doth use And every fair with his fair doth rehearse ,
358,Making a couplement of proud compare .
359,With sun and moon ,
360,with earth and sea 's rich gems ,
361,With April 's first-born flowers ,
362,and all things rare ,
363,That heaven 's air in this huge rondure hems .
364,O !
365,let me ,
366,true in love ,
367,but truly write ,
368,And then believe me ,
369,my love is as fair As any mother 's child ,
370,though not so bright As those gold candles fix 'd in heaven 's air :
371,Let them say more that like of hearsay well ;
372,I will not praise that purpose not to sell .
373,XXII My glass shall not persuade me I am old ,
374,So long as youth and thou are of one date ;
375,But when in thee time 's furrows I behold ,
376,Then look I death my days should expiate .
377,For all that beauty that doth cover thee ,
378,Is but the seemly raiment of my heart ,
379,Which in thy breast doth live ,
380,as thine in me :
381,How can I then be elder than thou art ?
382,O !
383,therefore love ,
384,be of thyself so wary As I ,
385,not for myself ,
386,but for thee will ;
387,Bearing thy heart ,
388,which I will keep so chary As tender nurse her babe from faring ill .
389,Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain ,
390,Thou gav ` st me thine not to give back again .
391,XXIII As an unperfect actor on the stage ,
392,Who with his fear is put beside his part ,
393,Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage ,
394,Whose strength 's abundance weakens his own heart ;
395,So I ,
396,for fear of trust ,
397,forget to say The perfect ceremony of love 's rite ,
398,And in mine own love 's strength seem to decay ,
399,O'ercharg 'd with burthen of mine own love 's might .
400,O !
401,let my looks be then the eloquence And dumb presagers of my speaking breast ,
402,Who plead for love ,
403,and look for recompense ,
404,More than that tongue that more hath more express 'd .
405,O !
406,learn to read what silent love hath writ :
407,To hear with eyes belongs to love 's fine wit .
408,XXIV Mine eye hath play 'd the painter and hath stell 'd ,
409,Thy beauty 's form in table of my heart ;
410,My body is the frame wherein ` tis held ,
411,And perspective it is best painter 's art .
412,For through the painter must you see his skill ,
413,To find where your true image pictur 'd lies ,
414,Which in my bosom 's shop is hanging still ,
415,That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes .
416,Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done :
417,Mine eyes have drawn thy shape ,
418,and thine for me Are windows to my breast ,
419,where-through the sun Delights to peep ,
420,to gaze therein on thee ;
421,Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art ,
422,They draw but what they see ,
423,know not the heart .
424,XXV Let those who are in favour with their stars Of public honour and proud titles boast ,
425,Whilst I ,
426,whom fortune of such triumph bars Unlook 'd for joy in that I honour most .
427,Great princes ' favourites their fair leaves spread But as the marigold at the sun 's eye ,
428,And in themselves their pride lies buried ,
429,For at a frown they in their glory die .
430,The painful warrior famoused for fight ,
431,After a thousand victories once foil 'd ,
432,Is from the book of honour razed quite ,
433,And all the rest forgot for which he toil 'd :
434,Then happy I ,
435,that love and am belov 'd ,
436,Where I may not remove nor be remov 'd .
437,XXVI Lord of my love ,
438,to whom in vassalage Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit ,
439,To thee I send this written embassage ,
440,To witness duty ,
441,not to show my wit :
442,Duty so great ,
443,which wit so poor as mine May make seem bare ,
444,in wanting words to show it ,
445,But that I hope some good conceit of thine In thy soul 's thought ,
446,all naked ,
447,will bestow it :
448,Till whatsoever star that guides my moving ,
449,Points on me graciously with fair aspect ,
450,And puts apparel on my tatter 'd loving ,
451,To show me worthy of thy sweet respect :
452,Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee ;
453,Till then ,
454,not show my head where thou mayst prove me .
455,XXVII Weary with toil ,
456,I haste me to my bed ,
457,The dear respose for limbs with travel tir 'd ;
458,But then begins a journey in my head To work my mind ,
459,when body 's work 's expired :
460,For then my thoughts -- from far where I abide -- Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee ,
461,And keep my drooping eyelids open wide ,
462,Looking on darkness which the blind do see :
463,Save that my soul 's imaginary sight Presents thy shadow to my sightless view ,
464,Which ,
465,like a jewel hung in ghastly night ,
466,Makes black night beauteous ,
467,and her old face new .
468,Lo !
469,thus ,
470,by day my limbs ,
471,by night my mind ,
472,For thee ,
473,and for myself ,
474,no quiet find .
475,XXVIII How can I then return in happy plight ,
476,That am debarre 'd the benefit of rest ?
477,When day 's oppression is not eas 'd by night ,
478,But day by night and night by day oppress 'd ,
479,And each ,
480,though enemies to either 's reign ,
481,Do in consent shake hands to torture me ,
482,The one by toil ,
483,the other to complain How far I toil ,
484,still farther off from thee .
485,I tell the day ,
486,to please him thou art bright ,
487,And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven :
488,So flatter I the swart-complexion 'd night ,
489,When sparkling stars twire not thou gild ` st the even .
490,But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer ,
491,And night doth nightly make grief 's length seem stronger .
492,XXIX When in disgrace with fortune and men 's eyes I all alone beweep my outcast state ,
493,And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries ,
494,And look upon myself ,
495,and curse my fate ,
496,Wishing me like to one more rich in hope ,
497,Featur 'd like him ,
498,like him with friends possess 'd ,
499,Desiring this man 's art ,
500,and that man 's scope ,
501,With what I most enjoy contented least ;
502,Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising ,
503,Haply I think on thee ,
504,-- and then my state ,
505,Like to the lark at break of day arising From sullen earth ,
506,sings hymns at heaven 's gate ;
507,For thy sweet love remember 'd such wealth brings That then I scorn to change my state with kings .
508,XXX When to the sessions of sweet silent thought I summon up remembrance of things past ,
509,I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought ,
510,And with old woes new wail my dear time 's waste :
511,Then can I drown an eye ,
512,unused to flow ,
513,For precious friends hid in death 's dateless night ,
514,And weep afresh love 's long since cancell 'd woe ,
515,And moan the expense of many a vanish 'd sight :
516,Then can I grieve at grievances foregone ,
517,And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan ,
518,Which I new pay as if not paid before .
519,But if the while I think on thee ,
520,dear friend ,
521,All losses are restor 'd and sorrows end .
522,XXXI Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts ,
523,Which I by lacking have supposed dead ;
524,And there reigns Love ,
525,and all Love 's loving parts ,
526,And all those friends which I thought buried .
527,How many a holy and obsequious tear Hath dear religious love stol 'n from mine eye ,
528,As interest of the dead ,
529,which now appear But things remov 'd that hidden in thee lie !
530,Thou art the grave where buried love doth live ,
531,Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone ,
532,Who all their parts of me to thee did give ,
533,That due of many now is thine alone :
534,Their images I lov 'd ,
535,I view in thee ,
536,And thou -- all they -- hast all the all of me .
537,XXXII If thou survive my well-contented day ,
538,When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover And shalt by fortune once more re-survey These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover ,
539,Compare them with the bett ` ring of the time ,
540,And though they be outstripp 'd by every pen ,
541,Reserve them for my love ,
542,not for their rhyme ,
543,Exceeded by the height of happier men .
544,O !
545,then vouchsafe me but this loving thought :
546,` Had my friend 's Muse grown with this growing age ,
547,A dearer birth than this his love had brought ,
548,To march in ranks of better equipage :
549,But since he died and poets better prove ,
550,Theirs for their style I 'll read ,
551,his for his love ' .
552,XXXIII Full many a glorious morning have I seen Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye ,
553,Kissing with golden face the meadows green ,
554,Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy ;
555,Anon permit the basest clouds to ride With ugly rack on his celestial face ,
556,And from the forlorn world his visage hide ,
557,Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace :
558,Even so my sun one early morn did shine ,
559,With all triumphant splendour on my brow ;
560,But out !
561,alack !
562,he was but one hour mine ,
563,The region cloud hath mask 'd him from me now .
564,Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth ;
565,Suns of the world may stain when heaven 's sun staineth .
566,XXXIV Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day ,
567,And make me travel forth without my cloak ,
568,To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way ,
569,Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke ?
570,` Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break ,
571,To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face ,
572,For no man well of such a salve can speak ,
573,That heals the wound ,
574,and cures not the disgrace :
575,Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief ;
576,Though thou repent ,
577,yet I have still the loss :
578,The offender 's sorrow lends but weak relief To him that bears the strong offence 's cross .
579,Ah !
580,but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds ,
581,And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds .
582,XXXV No more be griev 'd at that which thou hast done :
583,Roses have thorns ,
584,and silver fountains mud :
585,Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun ,
586,And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud .
587,All men make faults ,
588,and even I in this ,
589,Authorizing thy trespass with compare ,
590,Myself corrupting ,
591,salving thy amiss ,
592,Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are ;
593,For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense ,
594,-- Thy adverse party is thy advocate ,
595,-- And ` gainst myself a lawful plea commence :
596,Such civil war is in my love and hate ,
597,That I an accessary needs must be ,
598,To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me .
599,XXXVI Let me confess that we two must be twain ,
600,Although our undivided loves are one :
601,So shall those blots that do with me remain ,
602,Without thy help ,
603,by me be borne alone .
604,In our two loves there is but one respect ,
605,Though in our lives a separable spite ,
606,Which though it alter not love 's sole effect ,
607,Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love 's delight .
608,I may not evermore acknowledge thee ,
609,Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame ,
610,Nor thou with public kindness honour me ,
611,Unless thou take that honour from thy name :
612,But do not so ,
613,I love thee in such sort ,
614,As thou being mine ,
615,mine is thy good report .
616,XXXVII As a decrepit father takes delight To see his active child do deeds of youth ,
617,So I ,
618,made lame by Fortune 's dearest spite ,
619,Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth ;
620,For whether beauty ,
621,birth ,
622,or wealth ,
623,or wit ,
624,Or any of these all ,
625,or all ,
626,or more ,
627,Entitled in thy parts ,
628,do crowned sit ,
629,I make my love engrafted ,
630,to this store :
631,So then I am not lame ,
632,poor ,
633,nor despis 'd ,
634,Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give That I in thy abundance am suffic 'd ,
635,And by a part of all thy glory live .
636,Look what is best ,
637,that best I wish in thee :
638,This wish I have ;
639,then ten times happy me !
640,XXXVIII How can my muse want subject to invent ,
641,While thou dost breathe ,
642,that pour ` st into my verse Thine own sweet argument ,
643,too excellent For every vulgar paper to rehearse ?
644,O !
645,give thy self the thanks ,
646,if aught in me Worthy perusal stand against thy sight ;
647,For who 's so dumb that can not write to thee ,
648,When thou thy self dost give invention light ?
649,Be thou the tenth Muse ,
650,ten times more in worth Than those old nine which rhymers invocate ;
651,And he that calls on thee ,
652,let him bring forth Eternal numbers to outlive long date .
653,If my slight muse do please these curious days ,
654,The pain be mine ,
655,but thine shall be the praise .
656,XXXIX O !
657,how thy worth with manners may I sing ,
658,When thou art all the better part of me ?
659,What can mine own praise to mine own self bring ?
660,And what is ' t but mine own when I praise thee ?
661,Even for this ,
662,let us divided live ,
663,And our dear love lose name of single one ,
664,That by this separation I may give That due to thee which thou deserv ` st alone .
665,O absence !
666,what a torment wouldst thou prove ,
667,Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave ,
668,To entertain the time with thoughts of love ,
669,Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive ,
670,And that thou teachest how to make one twain ,
671,By praising him here who doth hence remain .
672,XL Take all my loves ,
673,my love ,
674,yea take them all ;
675,What hast thou then more than thou hadst before ?
676,No love ,
677,my love ,
678,that thou mayst true love call ;
679,All mine was thine ,
680,before thou hadst this more .
681,Then ,
682,if for my love ,
683,thou my love receivest ,
684,I can not blame thee ,
685,for my love thou usest ;
686,But yet be blam 'd ,
687,if thou thy self deceivest By wilful taste of what thyself refusest .
688,I do forgive thy robbery ,
689,gentle thief ,
690,Although thou steal thee all my poverty :
691,And yet ,
692,love knows it is a greater grief To bear love 's wrong ,
693,than hate 's known injury .
694,Lascivious grace ,
695,in whom all ill well shows ,
696,Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes .
697,XLI Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits ,
698,When I am sometime absent from thy heart ,
699,Thy beauty ,
700,and thy years full well befits ,
701,For still temptation follows where thou art .
702,Gentle thou art ,
703,and therefore to be won ,
704,Beauteous thou art ,
705,therefore to be assail 'd ;
706,And when a woman woos ,
707,what woman 's son Will sourly leave her till he have prevail 'd ?
708,Ay me !
709,but yet thou mightst my seat forbear ,
710,And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth ,
711,Who lead thee in their riot even there Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth :
712,-- Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee ,
713,Thine by thy beauty being false to me .
714,XLII That thou hast her it is not all my grief ,
715,And yet it may be said I loved her dearly ;
716,That she hath thee is of my wailing chief ,
717,A loss in love that touches me more nearly .
718,Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye :
719,Thou dost love her ,
720,because thou know ` st I love her ;
721,And for my sake even so doth she abuse me ,
722,Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her .
723,If I lose thee ,
724,my loss is my love 's gain ,
725,And losing her ,
726,my friend hath found that loss ;
727,Both find each other ,
728,and I lose both twain ,
729,And both for my sake lay on me this cross :
730,But here 's the joy ;
731,my friend and I are one ;
732,Sweet flattery !
733,then she loves but me alone .
734,XLIII When most I wink ,
735,then do mine eyes best see ,
736,For all the day they view things unrespected ;
737,But when I sleep ,
738,in dreams they look on thee ,
739,And darkly bright ,
740,are bright in dark directed .
741,Then thou ,
742,whose shadow shadows doth make bright ,
743,How would thy shadow 's form form happy show To the clear day with thy much clearer light ,
744,When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so !
745,How would ,
746,I say ,
747,mine eyes be blessed made By looking on thee in the living day ,
748,When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay !
749,All days are nights to see till I see thee ,
750,And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me .
751,XLIV If the dull substance of my flesh were thought ,
752,Injurious distance should not stop my way ;
753,For then despite of space I would be brought ,
754,From limits far remote ,
755,where thou dost stay .
756,No matter then although my foot did stand Upon the farthest earth remov 'd from thee ;
757,For nimble thought can jump both sea and land ,
758,As soon as think the place where he would be .
759,But ,
760,ah !
761,thought kills me that I am not thought ,
762,To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone ,
763,But that so much of earth and water wrought ,
764,I must attend time 's leisure with my moan ;
765,Receiving nought by elements so slow But heavy tears ,
766,badges of either 's woe .
767,XLV The other two ,
768,slight air ,
769,and purging fire Are both with thee ,
770,wherever I abide ;
771,The first my thought ,
772,the other my desire ,
773,These present-absent with swift motion slide .
774,For when these quicker elements are gone In tender embassy of love to thee ,
775,My life ,
776,being made of four ,
777,with two alone Sinks down to death ,
778,oppress 'd with melancholy ;
779,Until life 's composition be recur 'd By those swift messengers return 'd from thee ,
780,Who even but now come back again ,
781,assur 'd ,
782,Of thy fair health ,
783,recounting it to me :
784,This told ,
785,I joy ;
786,but then no longer glad ,
787,I send them back again ,
788,and straight grow sad .
789,XLVI Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war ,
790,How to divide the conquest of thy sight ;
791,Mine eye my heart thy picture 's sight would bar ,
792,My heart mine eye the freedom of that right .
793,My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie ,
794,-- A closet never pierc 'd with crystal eyes -- But the defendant doth that plea deny ,
795,And says in him thy fair appearance lies .
796,To side this title is impannelled A quest of thoughts ,
797,all tenants to the heart ;
798,And by their verdict is determined The clear eye 's moiety ,
799,and the dear heart 's part :
800,As thus ;
801,mine eye 's due is thy outward part ,
802,And my heart 's right ,
803,thy inward love of heart .
804,XLVII Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took ,
805,And each doth good turns now unto the other :
806,When that mine eye is famish 'd for a look ,
807,Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother ,
808,With my love 's picture then my eye doth feast ,
809,And to the painted banquet bids my heart ;
810,Another time mine eye is my heart 's guest ,
811,And in his thoughts of love doth share a part :
812,So ,
813,either by thy picture or my love ,
814,Thy self away ,
815,art present still with me ;
816,For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move ,
817,And I am still with them ,
818,and they with thee ;
819,Or ,
820,if they sleep ,
821,thy picture in my sight Awakes my heart ,
822,to heart 's and eye 's delight .
823,XLVIII How careful was I when I took my way ,
824,Each trifle under truest bars to thrust ,
825,That to my use it might unused stay From hands of falsehood ,
826,in sure wards of trust !
827,But thou ,
828,to whom my jewels trifles are ,
829,Most worthy comfort ,
830,now my greatest grief ,
831,Thou best of dearest ,
832,and mine only care ,
833,Art left the prey of every vulgar thief .
834,Thee have I not lock 'd up in any chest ,
835,Save where thou art not ,
836,though I feel thou art ,
837,Within the gentle closure of my breast ,
838,From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part ;
839,And even thence thou wilt be stol 'n I fear ,
840,For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear .
841,XLIX Against that time ,
842,if ever that time come ,
843,When I shall see thee frown on my defects ,
844,When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum ,
845,Call 'd to that audit by advis 'd respects ;
846,Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass ,
847,And scarcely greet me with that sun ,
848,thine eye ,
849,When love ,
850,converted from the thing it was ,
851,Shall reasons find of settled gravity ;
852,Against that time do I ensconce me here ,
853,Within the knowledge of mine own desert ,
854,And this my hand ,
855,against my self uprear ,
856,To guard the lawful reasons on thy part :
857,To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws ,
858,Since why to love I can allege no cause .
859,L How heavy do I journey on the way ,
860,When what I seek ,
861,my weary travel 's end ,
862,Doth teach that ease and that repose to say ,
863,` Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend ! '
864,The beast that bears me ,
865,tired with my woe ,
866,Plods dully on ,
867,to bear that weight in me ,
868,As if by some instinct the wretch did know His rider lov 'd not speed ,
869,being made from thee :
870,The bloody spur can not provoke him on ,
871,That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide ,
872,Which heavily he answers with a groan ,
873,More sharp to me than spurring to his side ;
874,For that same groan doth put this in my mind ,
875,My grief lies onward ,
876,and my joy behind .
877,LI Thus can my love excuse the slow offence Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed :
878,From where thou art why should I haste me thence ?
879,Till I return ,
880,of posting is no need .
881,O !
882,what excuse will my poor beast then find ,
883,When swift extremity can seem but slow ?
884,Then should I spur ,
885,though mounted on the wind ,
886,In winged speed no motion shall I know ,
887,Then can no horse with my desire keep pace ;
888,Therefore desire ,
889,of perfect ` st love being made ,
890,Shall neigh -- no dull flesh -- in his fiery race ;
891,But love ,
892,for love ,
893,thus shall excuse my jade ,
894,-- ` Since from thee going ,
895,he went wilful-slow ,
896,Towards thee I 'll run ,
897,and give him leave to go . '
898,LII So am I as the rich ,
899,whose blessed key ,
900,Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure ,
901,The which he will not every hour survey ,
902,For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure .
903,Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare ,
904,Since ,
905,seldom coming in that long year set ,
906,Like stones of worth they thinly placed are ,
907,Or captain jewels in the carcanet .
908,So is the time that keeps you as my chest ,
909,Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide ,
910,To make some special instant special-blest ,
911,By new unfolding his imprison 'd pride .
912,Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope ,
913,Being had ,
914,to triumph ;
915,being lacked ,
916,to hope .
917,LIII What is your substance ,
918,whereof are you made ,
919,That millions of strange shadows on you tend ?
920,Since every one ,
921,hath every one ,
922,one shade ,
923,And you but one ,
924,can every shadow lend .
925,Describe Adonis ,
926,and the counterfeit Is poorly imitated after you ;
927,On Helen 's cheek all art of beauty set ,
928,And you in Grecian tires are painted new :
929,Speak of the spring ,
930,and foison of the year ,
931,The one doth shadow of your beauty show ,
932,The other as your bounty doth appear ;
933,And you in every blessed shape we know .
934,In all external grace you have some part ,
935,But you like none ,
936,none you ,
937,for constant heart .
938,LIV O !
939,how much more doth beauty beauteous seem By that sweet ornament which truth doth give .
940,The rose looks fair ,
941,but fairer we it deem For that sweet odour ,
942,which doth in it live .
943,The canker blooms have full as deep a dye As the perfumed tincture of the roses .
944,Hang on such thorns ,
945,and play as wantonly When summer 's breath their masked buds discloses :
946,But ,
947,for their virtue only is their show ,
948,They live unwoo 'd ,
949,and unrespected fade ;
950,Die to themselves .
951,Sweet roses do not so ;
952,Of their sweet deaths ,
953,are sweetest odours made :
954,And so of you ,
955,beauteous and lovely youth ,
956,When that shall vade ,
957,by verse distills your truth .
958,LV Not marble ,
959,nor the gilded monuments Of princes ,
960,shall outlive this powerful rhyme ;
961,But you shall shine more bright in these contents Than unswept stone ,
962,besmear 'd with sluttish time .
963,When wasteful war shall statues overturn ,
964,And broils root out the work of masonry ,
965,Nor Mars his sword ,
966,nor war 's quick fire shall burn The living record of your memory .
967,` Gainst death ,
968,and all-oblivious enmity Shall you pace forth ;
969,your praise shall still find room Even in the eyes of all posterity That wear this world out to the ending doom .
970,So ,
971,till the judgment that yourself arise ,
972,You live in this ,
973,and dwell in lovers ' eyes .
974,LVI Sweet love ,
975,renew thy force ;
976,be it not said Thy edge should blunter be than appetite ,
977,Which but to-day by feeding is allay 'd ,
978,To-morrow sharpened in his former might :
979,So ,
980,love ,
981,be thou ,
982,although to-day thou fill Thy hungry eyes ,
983,even till they wink with fulness ,
984,To-morrow see again ,
985,and do not kill The spirit of love ,
986,with a perpetual dulness .
987,Let this sad interim like the ocean be Which parts the shore ,
988,where two contracted new Come daily to the banks ,
989,that when they see Return of love ,
990,more blest may be the view ;
991,Or call it winter ,
992,which being full of care ,
993,Makes summer 's welcome ,
994,thrice more wished ,
995,more rare .
996,LVII Being your slave what should I do but tend ,
997,Upon the hours ,
998,and times of your desire ?
999,I have no precious time at all to spend ;
1000,Nor services to do ,
1001,till you require .
1002,Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour ,
1003,Whilst I ,
1004,my sovereign ,
1005,watch the clock for you ,
1006,Nor think the bitterness of absence sour ,
1007,When you have bid your servant once adieu ;
1008,Nor dare I question with my jealous thought Where you may be ,
1009,or your affairs suppose ,
1010,But ,
1011,like a sad slave ,
1012,stay and think of nought Save ,
1013,where you are ,
1014,how happy you make those .
1015,So true a fool is love ,
1016,that in your will ,
1017,Though you do anything ,
1018,he thinks no ill .
1019,LVIII That god forbid ,
1020,that made me first your slave ,
1021,I should in thought control your times of pleasure ,
1022,Or at your hand the account of hours to crave ,
1023,Being your vassal ,
1024,bound to stay your leisure !
1025,O !
1026,let me suffer ,
1027,being at your beck ,
1028,The imprison 'd absence of your liberty ;
1029,And patience ,
1030,tame to sufferance ,
1031,bide each check ,
1032,Without accusing you of injury .
1033,Be where you list ,
1034,your charter is so strong That you yourself may privilage your time To what you will ;
1035,to you it doth belong Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime .
1036,I am to wait ,
1037,though waiting so be hell ,
1038,Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well .
1039,LIX If there be nothing new ,
1040,but that which is Hath been before ,
1041,how are our brains beguil 'd ,
1042,Which labouring for invention bear amiss The second burthen of a former child !
1043,O !
1044,that record could with a backward look ,
1045,Even of five hundred courses of the sun ,
1046,Show me your image in some antique book ,
1047,Since mind at first in character was done !
1048,That I might see what the old world could say To this composed wonder of your frame ;
1049,Wh ' r we are mended ,
1050,or wh ' r better they ,
1051,Or whether revolution be the same .
1052,O !
1053,sure I am the wits of former days ,
1054,To subjects worse have given admiring praise .
1055,LX Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore ,
1056,So do our minutes hasten to their end ;
1057,Each changing place with that which goes before ,
1058,In sequent toil all forwards do contend .
1059,Nativity ,
1060,once in the main of light ,
1061,Crawls to maturity ,
1062,wherewith being crown 'd ,
1063,Crooked eclipses ` gainst his glory fight ,
1064,And Time that gave doth now his gift confound .
1065,Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth And delves the parallels in beauty 's brow ,
1066,Feeds on the rarities of nature 's truth ,
1067,And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow :
1068,And yet to times in hope ,
1069,my verse shall stand .
1070,Praising thy worth ,
1071,despite his cruel hand .
1072,LXI Is it thy will ,
1073,thy image should keep open My heavy eyelids to the weary night ?
1074,Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken ,
1075,While shadows like to thee do mock my sight ?
1076,Is it thy spirit that thou send ` st from thee So far from home into my deeds to pry ,
1077,To find out shames and idle hours in me ,
1078,The scope and tenure of thy jealousy ?
1079,O ,
1080,no !
1081,thy love ,
1082,though much ,
1083,is not so great :
1084,It is my love that keeps mine eye awake :
1085,Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat ,
1086,To play the watchman ever for thy sake :
1087,For thee watch I ,
1088,whilst thou dost wake elsewhere ,
1089,From me far off ,
1090,with others all too near .
1091,LXII Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye And all my soul ,
1092,and all my every part ;
1093,And for this sin there is no remedy ,
1094,It is so grounded inward in my heart .
1095,Methinks no face so gracious is as mine ,
1096,No shape so true ,
1097,no truth of such account ;
1098,And for myself mine own worth do define ,
1099,As I all other in all worths surmount .
1100,But when my glass shows me myself indeed Beated and chopp 'd with tanned antiquity ,
1101,Mine own self-love quite contrary I read ;
1102,Self so self-loving were iniquity .
1103,` Tis thee ,
1104,-- myself ,
1105,-- that for myself I praise ,
1106,Painting my age with beauty of thy days .
1107,LXIII Against my love shall be as I am now ,
1108,With Time 's injurious hand crush 'd and o'erworn ;
1109,When hours have drain 'd his blood and fill 'd his brow With lines and wrinkles ;
1110,when his youthful morn Hath travell 'd on to age 's steepy night ;
1111,And all those beauties whereof now he 's king Are vanishing ,
1112,or vanished out of sight ,
1113,Stealing away the treasure of his spring ;
1114,For such a time do I now fortify Against confounding age 's cruel knife ,
1115,That he shall never cut from memory My sweet love 's beauty ,
1116,though my lover 's life :
1117,His beauty shall in these black lines be seen ,
1118,And they shall live ,
1119,and he in them still green .
1120,LXIV When I have seen by Time 's fell hand defac 'd The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age ;
1121,When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz 'd ,
1122,And brass eternal slave to mortal rage ;
1123,When I have seen the hungry ocean gain Advantage on the kingdom of the shore ,
1124,And the firm soil win of the watery main ,
1125,Increasing store with loss ,
1126,and loss with store ;
1127,When I have seen such interchange of state ,
1128,Or state itself confounded ,
1129,to decay ;
1130,Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate -- That Time will come and take my love away .
1131,This thought is as a death which can not choose But weep to have ,
1132,that which it fears to lose .
1133,LXV Since brass ,
1134,nor stone ,
1135,nor earth ,
1136,nor boundless sea ,
1137,But sad mortality o'ersways their power ,
1138,How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea ,
1139,Whose action is no stronger than a flower ?
1140,O !
1141,how shall summer 's honey breath hold out ,
1142,Against the wrackful siege of battering days ,
1143,When rocks impregnable are not so stout ,
1144,Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays ?
1145,O fearful meditation !
1146,where ,
1147,alack ,
1148,Shall Time 's best jewel from Time 's chest lie hid ?
1149,Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back ?
1150,Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid ?
1151,O !
1152,none ,
1153,unless this miracle have might ,
1154,That in black ink my love may still shine bright .
1155,LXVI Tired with all these ,
1156,for restful death I cry ,
1157,As to behold desert a beggar born ,
1158,And needy nothing trimm 'd in jollity ,
1159,And purest faith unhappily forsworn ,
1160,And gilded honour shamefully misplac 'd ,
1161,And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted ,
1162,And right perfection wrongfully disgrac 'd ,
1163,And strength by limping sway disabled And art made tongue-tied by authority ,
1164,And folly -- doctor-like -- controlling skill ,
1165,And simple truth miscall 'd simplicity ,
1166,And captive good attending captain ill :
1167,Tir 'd with all these ,
1168,from these would I be gone ,
1169,Save that ,
1170,to die ,
1171,I leave my love alone .
1172,LXVII Ah !
1173,wherefore with infection should he live ,
1174,And with his presence grace impiety ,
1175,That sin by him advantage should achieve ,
1176,And lace itself with his society ?
1177,Why should false painting imitate his cheek ,
1178,And steel dead seeming of his living hue ?
1179,Why should poor beauty indirectly seek Roses of shadow ,
1180,since his rose is true ?
1181,Why should he live ,
1182,now Nature bankrupt is ,
1183,Beggar 'd of blood to blush through lively veins ?
1184,For she hath no exchequer now but his ,
1185,And proud of many ,
1186,lives upon his gains .
1187,O !
1188,him she stores ,
1189,to show what wealth she had In days long since ,
1190,before these last so bad .
1191,LXVIII Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn ,
1192,When beauty lived and died as flowers do now ,
1193,Before these bastard signs of fair were born ,
1194,Or durst inhabit on a living brow ;
1195,Before the golden tresses of the dead ,
1196,The right of sepulchres ,
1197,were shorn away ,
1198,To live a second life on second head ;
1199,Ere beauty 's dead fleece made another gay :
1200,In him those holy antique hours are seen ,
1201,Without all ornament ,
1202,itself and true ,
1203,Making no summer of another 's green ,
1204,Robbing no old to dress his beauty new ;
1205,And him as for a map doth Nature store ,
1206,To show false Art what beauty was of yore .
1207,LXIX Those parts of thee that the world 's eye doth view Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend ;
1208,All tongues -- the voice of souls -- give thee that due ,
1209,Uttering bare truth ,
1210,even so as foes commend .
1211,Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown 'd ;
1212,But those same tongues ,
1213,that give thee so thine own ,
1214,In other accents do this praise confound By seeing farther than the eye hath shown .
1215,They look into the beauty of thy mind ,
1216,And that in guess they measure by thy deeds ;
1217,Then -- churls -- their thoughts ,
1218,although their eyes were kind ,
1219,To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds :
1220,But why thy odour matcheth not thy show ,
1221,The soil is this ,
1222,that thou dost common grow .
1223,LXX That thou art blam 'd shall not be thy defect ,
1224,For slander 's mark was ever yet the fair ;
1225,The ornament of beauty is suspect ,
1226,A crow that flies in heaven 's sweetest air .
1227,So thou be good ,
1228,slander doth but approve Thy worth the greater being woo 'd of time ;
1229,For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love ,
1230,And thou present ` st a pure unstained prime .
1231,Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days Either not assail 'd ,
1232,or victor being charg 'd ;
1233,Yet this thy praise can not be so thy praise ,
1234,To tie up envy ,
1235,evermore enlarg 'd ,
1236,If some suspect of ill mask 'd not thy show ,
1237,Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe .
1238,LXXI No longer mourn for me when I am dead Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell Give warning to the world that I am fled From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell :
1239,Nay ,
1240,if you read this line ,
1241,remember not The hand that writ it ,
1242,for I love you so ,
1243,That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot ,
1244,If thinking on me then should make you woe .
1245,O !
1246,if ,
1247,-- I say you look upon this verse ,
1248,When I perhaps compounded am with clay ,
1249,Do not so much as my poor name rehearse ;
1250,But let your love even with my life decay ;
1251,Lest the wise world should look into your moan ,
1252,And mock you with me after I am gone .
1253,LXXII O !
1254,lest the world should task you to recite What merit lived in me ,
1255,that you should love After my death ,
1256,-- dear love ,
1257,forget me quite ,
1258,For you in me can nothing worthy prove ;
1259,Unless you would devise some virtuous lie ,
1260,To do more for me than mine own desert ,
1261,And hang more praise upon deceased I Than niggard truth would willingly impart :
1262,O !
1263,lest your true love may seem false in this That you for love speak well of me untrue ,
1264,My name be buried where my body is ,
1265,And live no more to shame nor me nor you .
1266,For I am shamed by that which I bring forth ,
1267,And so should you ,
1268,to love things nothing worth .
1269,LXXIII That time of year thou mayst in me behold When yellow leaves ,
1270,or none ,
1271,or few ,
1272,do hang Upon those boughs which shake against the cold ,
1273,Bare ruin 'd choirs ,
1274,where late the sweet birds sang .
1275,In me thou see ` st the twilight of such day As after sunset fadeth in the west ;
1276,Which by and by black night doth take away ,
1277,Death 's second self ,
1278,that seals up all in rest .
1279,In me thou see ` st the glowing of such fire ,
1280,That on the ashes of his youth doth lie ,
1281,As the death-bed ,
1282,whereon it must expire ,
1283,Consum 'd with that which it was nourish 'd by .
1284,This thou perceiv ` st ,
1285,which makes thy love more strong ,
1286,To love that well ,
1287,which thou must leave ere long .
1288,LXXIV But be contented :
1289,when that fell arrest Without all bail shall carry me away ,
1290,My life hath in this line some interest ,
1291,Which for memorial still with thee shall stay .
1292,When thou reviewest this ,
1293,thou dost review The very part was consecrate to thee :
1294,The earth can have but earth ,
1295,which is his due ;
1296,My spirit is thine ,
1297,the better part of me :
1298,So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life ,
1299,The prey of worms ,
1300,my body being dead ;
1301,The coward conquest of a wretch 's knife ,
1302,Too base of thee to be remembered .
1303,The worth of that is that which it contains ,
1304,And that is this ,
1305,and this with thee remains .
1306,LXXV So are you to my thoughts as food to life ,
1307,Or as sweet-season 'd showers are to the ground ;
1308,And for the peace of you I hold such strife As ` twixt a miser and his wealth is found .
1309,Now proud as an enjoyer ,
1310,and anon Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure ;
1311,Now counting best to be with you alone ,
1312,Then better 'd that the world may see my pleasure :
1313,Sometime all full with feasting on your sight ,
1314,And by and by clean starved for a look ;
1315,Possessing or pursuing no delight ,
1316,Save what is had ,
1317,or must from you be took .
1318,Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day ,
1319,Or gluttoning on all ,
1320,or all away .
1321,LXXVI Why is my verse so barren of new pride ,
1322,So far from variation or quick change ?
1323,Why with the time do I not glance aside To new-found methods ,
1324,and to compounds strange ?
1325,Why write I still all one ,
1326,ever the same ,
1327,And keep invention in a noted weed ,
1328,That every word doth almost tell my name ,
1329,Showing their birth ,
1330,and where they did proceed ?
1331,O !
1332,know sweet love I always write of you ,
1333,And you and love are still my argument ;
1334,So all my best is dressing old words new ,
1335,Spending again what is already spent :
1336,For as the sun is daily new and old ,
1337,So is my love still telling what is told .
1338,LXXVII Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear ,
1339,Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste ;
1340,These vacant leaves thy mind 's imprint will bear ,
1341,And of this book ,
1342,this learning mayst thou taste .
1343,The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show Of mouthed graves will give thee memory ;
1344,Thou by thy dial 's shady stealth mayst know Time 's thievish progress to eternity .
1345,Look !
1346,what thy memory can not contain ,
1347,Commit to these waste blanks ,
1348,and thou shalt find Those children nursed ,
1349,deliver 'd from thy brain ,
1350,To take a new acquaintance of thy mind .
1351,These offices ,
1352,so oft as thou wilt look ,
1353,Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book .
1354,LXXVIII So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse ,
1355,And found such fair assistance in my verse As every alien pen hath got my use And under thee their poesy disperse .
1356,Thine eyes ,
1357,that taught the dumb on high to sing And heavy ignorance aloft to fly ,
1358,Have added feathers to the learned 's wing And given grace a double majesty .
1359,Yet be most proud of that which I compile ,
1360,Whose influence is thine ,
1361,and born of thee :
1362,In others ' works thou dost but mend the style ,
1363,And arts with thy sweet graces graced be ;
1364,But thou art all my art ,
1365,and dost advance As high as learning ,
1366,my rude ignorance .
1367,LXXIX Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid ,
1368,My verse alone had all thy gentle grace ;
1369,But now my gracious numbers are decay 'd ,
1370,And my sick Muse doth give an other place .
1371,I grant ,
1372,sweet love ,
1373,thy lovely argument Deserves the travail of a worthier pen ;
1374,Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent He robs thee of ,
1375,and pays it thee again .
1376,He lends thee virtue ,
1377,and he stole that word From thy behaviour ;
1378,beauty doth he give ,
1379,And found it in thy cheek :
1380,he can afford No praise to thee ,
1381,but what in thee doth live .
1382,Then thank him not for that which he doth say ,
1383,Since what he owes thee ,
1384,thou thyself dost pay .
1385,LXXX O !
1386,how I faint when I of you do write ,
1387,Knowing a better spirit doth use your name ,
1388,And in the praise thereof spends all his might ,
1389,To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame !
1390,But since your worth -- wide as the ocean is ,
1391,-- The humble as the proudest sail doth bear ,
1392,My saucy bark ,
1393,inferior far to his ,
1394,On your broad main doth wilfully appear .
1395,Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat ,
1396,Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride ;
1397,Or ,
1398,being wrack 'd ,
1399,I am a worthless boat ,
1400,He of tall building ,
1401,and of goodly pride :
1402,Then if he thrive and I be cast away ,
1403,The worst was this ,
1404,-- my love was my decay .
1405,LXXXI Or I shall live your epitaph to make ,
1406,Or you survive when I in earth am rotten ;
1407,From hence your memory death can not take ,
1408,Although in me each part will be forgotten .
1409,Your name from hence immortal life shall have ,
1410,Though I ,
1411,once gone ,
1412,to all the world must die :
1413,The earth can yield me but a common grave ,
1414,When you entombed in men 's eyes shall lie .
1415,Your monument shall be my gentle verse ,
1416,Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read ;
1417,And tongues to be ,
1418,your being shall rehearse ,
1419,When all the breathers of this world are dead ;
1420,You still shall live ,
1421,-- such virtue hath my pen ,
1422,-- Where breath most breathes ,
1423,even in the mouths of men .
1424,LXXXII I grant thou wert not married to my Muse ,
1425,And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook The dedicated words which writers use Of their fair subject ,
1426,blessing every book .
1427,Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue ,
1428,Finding thy worth a limit past my praise ;
1429,And therefore art enforced to seek anew Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days .
1430,And do so ,
1431,love ;
1432,yet when they have devis 'd ,
1433,What strained touches rhetoric can lend ,
1434,Thou truly fair ,
1435,wert truly sympathiz 'd In true plain words ,
1436,by thy true-telling friend ;
1437,And their gross painting might be better us 'd Where cheeks need blood ;
1438,in thee it is abus 'd .
1439,LXXXIII I never saw that you did painting need ,
1440,And therefore to your fair no painting set ;
1441,I found ,
1442,or thought I found ,
1443,you did exceed That barren tender of a poet 's debt :
1444,And therefore have I slept in your report ,
1445,That you yourself ,
1446,being extant ,
1447,well might show How far a modern quill doth come too short ,
1448,Speaking of worth ,
1449,what worth in you doth grow .
1450,This silence for my sin you did impute ,
1451,Which shall be most my glory being dumb ;
1452,For I impair not beauty being mute ,
1453,When others would give life ,
1454,and bring a tomb .
1455,There lives more life in one of your fair eyes Than both your poets can in praise devise .
1456,LXXXIV Who is it that says most ,
1457,which can say more ,
1458,Than this rich praise ,
1459,-- that you alone ,
1460,are you ?
1461,In whose confine immured is the store Which should example where your equal grew .
1462,Lean penury within that pen doth dwell That to his subject lends not some small glory ;
1463,But he that writes of you ,
1464,if he can tell That you are you ,
1465,so dignifies his story ,
1466,Let him but copy what in you is writ ,
1467,Not making worse what nature made so clear ,
1468,And such a counterpart shall fame his wit ,
1469,Making his style admired every where .
1470,You to your beauteous blessings add a curse ,
1471,Being fond on praise ,
1472,which makes your praises worse .
1473,LXXXV My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still ,
1474,While comments of your praise richly compil 'd ,
1475,Reserve their character with golden quill ,
1476,And precious phrase by all the Muses fil 'd .
1477,I think good thoughts ,
1478,whilst others write good words ,
1479,And like unlettered clerk still cry ` Amen ' To every hymn that able spirit affords ,
1480,In polish 'd form of well-refined pen .
1481,Hearing you praised ,
1482,I say '' tis so ,
1483,` tis true , '
1484,And to the most of praise add something more ;
1485,But that is in my thought ,
1486,whose love to you ,
1487,Though words come hindmost ,
1488,holds his rank before .
1489,Then others ,
1490,for the breath of words respect ,
1491,Me for my dumb thoughts ,
1492,speaking in effect .
1493,LXXXVI Was it the proud full sail of his great verse ,
1494,Bound for the prize of all too precious you ,
1495,That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse ,
1496,Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew ?
1497,Was it his spirit ,
1498,by spirits taught to write ,
1499,Above a mortal pitch ,
1500,that struck me dead ?
1501,No ,
1502,neither he ,
1503,nor his compeers by night Giving him aid ,
1504,my verse astonished .
1505,He ,
1506,nor that affable familiar ghost Which nightly gulls him with intelligence ,
1507,As victors of my silence can not boast ;
1508,I was not sick of any fear from thence :
1509,But when your countenance fill 'd up his line ,
1510,Then lacked I matter ;
1511,that enfeebled mine .
1512,LXXXVII Farewell !
1513,thou art too dear for my possessing ,
1514,And like enough thou know ` st thy estimate ,
1515,The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing ;
1516,My bonds in thee are all determinate .
1517,For how do I hold thee but by thy granting ?
1518,And for that riches where is my deserving ?
1519,The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting ,
1520,And so my patent back again is swerving .
1521,Thy self thou gav ` st ,
1522,thy own worth then not knowing ,
1523,Or me to whom thou gav ` st it ,
1524,else mistaking ;
1525,So thy great gift ,
1526,upon misprision growing ,
1527,Comes home again ,
1528,on better judgement making .
1529,Thus have I had thee ,
1530,as a dream doth flatter ,
1531,In sleep a king ,
1532,but waking no such matter .
1533,LXXXVIII When thou shalt be dispos 'd to set me light ,
1534,And place my merit in the eye of scorn ,
1535,Upon thy side ,
1536,against myself I 'll fight ,
1537,And prove thee virtuous ,
1538,though thou art forsworn .
1539,With mine own weakness ,
1540,being best acquainted ,
1541,Upon thy part I can set down a story Of faults conceal 'd ,
1542,wherein I am attainted ;
1543,That thou in losing me shalt win much glory :
1544,And I by this will be a gainer too ;
1545,For bending all my loving thoughts on thee ,
1546,The injuries that to myself I do ,
1547,Doing thee vantage ,
1548,double-vantage me .
1549,Such is my love ,
1550,to thee I so belong ,
1551,That for thy right ,
1552,myself will bear all wrong .
1553,LXXXIX Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault ,
1554,And I will comment upon that offence :
1555,Speak of my lameness ,
1556,and I straight will halt ,
1557,Against thy reasons making no defence .
1558,Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill ,
1559,To set a form upon desired change ,
1560,As I 'll myself disgrace ;
1561,knowing thy will ,
1562,I will acquaintance strangle ,
1563,and look strange ;
1564,Be absent from thy walks ;
1565,and in my tongue Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell ,
1566,Lest I ,
1567,too much profane ,
1568,should do it wrong ,
1569,And haply of our old acquaintance tell .
1570,For thee ,
1571,against my self I 'll vow debate ,
1572,For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate .
1573,XC Then hate me when thou wilt ;
1574,if ever ,
1575,now ;
1576,Now ,
1577,while the world is bent my deeds to cross ,
1578,Join with the spite of fortune ,
1579,make me bow ,
1580,And do not drop in for an after-loss :
1581,Ah !
1582,do not ,
1583,when my heart hath ` scap 'd this sorrow ,
1584,Come in the rearward of a conquer 'd woe ;
1585,Give not a windy night a rainy morrow ,
1586,To linger out a purpos 'd overthrow .
1587,If thou wilt leave me ,
1588,do not leave me last ,
1589,When other petty griefs have done their spite ,
1590,But in the onset come :
1591,so shall I taste At first the very worst of fortune 's might ;
1592,And other strains of woe ,
1593,which now seem woe ,
1594,Compar 'd with loss of thee ,
1595,will not seem so .
1596,XCI Some glory in their birth ,
1597,some in their skill ,
1598,Some in their wealth ,
1599,some in their body 's force ,
1600,Some in their garments though new-fangled ill ;
1601,Some in their hawks and hounds ,
1602,some in their horse ;
1603,And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure ,
1604,Wherein it finds a joy above the rest :
1605,But these particulars are not my measure ,
1606,All these I better in one general best .
1607,Thy love is better than high birth to me ,
1608,Richer than wealth ,
1609,prouder than garments ' costs ,
1610,Of more delight than hawks and horses be ;
1611,And having thee ,
1612,of all men 's pride I boast :
1613,Wretched in this alone ,
1614,that thou mayst take All this away ,
1615,and me most wretchcd make .
1616,XCII But do thy worst to steal thyself away ,
1617,For term of life thou art assured mine ;
1618,And life no longer than thy love will stay ,
1619,For it depends upon that love of thine .
1620,Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs ,
1621,When in the least of them my life hath end .
1622,I see a better state to me belongs Than that which on thy humour doth depend :
1623,Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind ,
1624,Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie .
1625,O !
1626,what a happy title do I find ,
1627,Happy to have thy love ,
1628,happy to die !
1629,But what 's so blessed-fair that fears no blot ?
1630,Thou mayst be false ,
1631,and yet I know it not .
1632,XCIII So shall I live ,
1633,supposing thou art true ,
1634,Like a deceived husband ;
1635,so love 's face May still seem love to me ,
1636,though alter 'd new ;
1637,Thy looks with me ,
1638,thy heart in other place :
1639,For there can live no hatred in thine eye ,
1640,Therefore in that I can not know thy change .
1641,In many 's looks ,
1642,the false heart 's history Is writ in moods ,
1643,and frowns ,
1644,and wrinkles strange .
1645,But heaven in thy creation did decree That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell ;
1646,Whate'er thy thoughts ,
1647,or thy heart 's workings be ,
1648,Thy looks should nothing thence ,
1649,but sweetness tell .
1650,How like Eve 's apple doth thy beauty grow ,
1651,If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show !
1652,XCIV They that have power to hurt ,
1653,and will do none ,
1654,That do not do the thing they most do show ,
1655,Who ,
1656,moving others ,
1657,are themselves as stone ,
1658,Unmoved ,
1659,cold ,
1660,and to temptation slow ;
1661,They rightly do inherit heaven 's graces ,
1662,And husband nature 's riches from expense ;
1663,They are the lords and owners of their faces ,
1664,Others ,
1665,but stewards of their excellence .
1666,The summer 's flower is to the summer sweet ,
1667,Though to itself ,
1668,it only live and die ,
1669,But if that flower with base infection meet ,
1670,The basest weed outbraves his dignity :
1671,For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds ;
1672,Lilies that fester ,
1673,smell far worse than weeds .
1674,XCV How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame Which ,
1675,like a canker in the fragrant rose ,
1676,Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name !
1677,O !
1678,in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose .
1679,That tongue that tells the story of thy days ,
1680,Making lascivious comments on thy sport ,
1681,Can not dispraise ,
1682,but in a kind of praise ;
1683,Naming thy name ,
1684,blesses an ill report .
1685,O !
1686,what a mansion have those vices got Which for their habitation chose out thee ,
1687,Where beauty 's veil doth cover every blot And all things turns to fair that eyes can see !
1688,Take heed ,
1689,dear heart ,
1690,of this large privilege ;
1691,The hardest knife ill-us 'd doth lose his edge .
1692,XCVI Some say thy fault is youth ,
1693,some wantonness ;
1694,Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport ;
1695,Both grace and faults are lov 'd of more and less :
1696,Thou mak ` st faults graces that to thee resort .
1697,As on the finger of a throned queen The basest jewel will be well esteem 'd ,
1698,So are those errors that in thee are seen To truths translated ,
1699,and for true things deem 'd .
1700,How many lambs might the stern wolf betray ,
1701,If like a lamb he could his looks translate !
1702,How many gazers mightst thou lead away ,
1703,if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state !
1704,But do not so ;
1705,I love thee in such sort ,
1706,As ,
1707,thou being mine ,
1708,mine is thy good report .
1709,XCVII How like a winter hath my absence been From thee ,
1710,the pleasure of the fleeting year !
1711,What freezings have I felt ,
1712,what dark days seen !
1713,What old December 's bareness everywhere !
1714,And yet this time removed was summer 's time ;
1715,The teeming autumn ,
1716,big with rich increase ,
1717,Bearing the wanton burden of the prime ,
1718,Like widow 'd wombs after their lords ' decease :
1719,Yet this abundant issue seem 'd to me But hope of orphans ,
1720,and unfather 'd fruit ;
1721,For summer and his pleasures wait on thee ,
1722,And ,
1723,thou away ,
1724,the very birds are mute :
1725,Or ,
1726,if they sing ,
1727,` tis with so dull a cheer ,
1728,That leaves look pale ,
1729,dreading the winter 's near .
1730,XCVIII From you have I been absent in the spring ,
1731,When proud-pied April ,
1732,dress 'd in all his trim ,
1733,Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing ,
1734,That heavy Saturn laugh 'd and leap 'd with him .
1735,Yet nor the lays of birds ,
1736,nor the sweet smell Of different flowers in odour and in hue ,
1737,Could make me any summer 's story tell ,
1738,Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew :
1739,Nor did I wonder at the lily 's white ,
1740,Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose ;
1741,They were but sweet ,
1742,but figures of delight ,
1743,Drawn after you ,
1744,you pattern of all those .
1745,Yet seem 'd it winter still ,
1746,and you away ,
1747,As with your shadow I with these did play .
1748,XCIX The forward violet thus did I chide :
1749,Sweet thief ,
1750,whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells ,
1751,If not from my love 's breath ?
1752,The purple pride Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells In my love 's veins thou hast too grossly dy 'd .
1753,The lily I condemned for thy hand ,
1754,And buds of marjoram had stol 'n thy hair ;
1755,The roses fearfully on thorns did stand ,
1756,One blushing shame ,
1757,another white despair ;
1758,A third ,
1759,nor red nor white ,
1760,had stol 'n of both ,
1761,And to his robbery had annex 'd thy breath ;
1762,But ,
1763,for his theft ,
1764,in pride of all his growth A vengeful canker eat him up to death .
1765,More flowers I noted ,
1766,yet I none could see ,
1767,But sweet ,
1768,or colour it had stol 'n from thee .
1769,C Where art thou Muse that thou forget ` st so long ,
1770,To speak of that which gives thee all thy might ?
1771,Spend ` st thou thy fury on some worthless song ,
1772,Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light ?
1773,Return forgetful Muse ,
1774,and straight redeem ,
1775,In gentle numbers time so idly spent ;
1776,Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem And gives thy pen both skill and argument .
1777,Rise ,
1778,resty Muse ,
1779,my love 's sweet face survey ,
1780,If Time have any wrinkle graven there ;
1781,If any ,
1782,be a satire to decay ,
1783,And make time 's spoils despised every where .
1784,Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life ,
1785,So thou prevent ` st his scythe and crooked knife .
1786,CI O truant Muse what shall be thy amends For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy 'd ?
1787,Both truth and beauty on my love depends ;
1788,So dost thou too ,
1789,and therein dignified .
1790,Make answer Muse :
1791,wilt thou not haply say ,
1792,` Truth needs no colour ,
1793,with his colour fix 'd ;
1794,Beauty no pencil ,
1795,beauty 's truth to lay ;
1796,But best is best ,
1797,if never intermix 'd ' ?
1798,Because he needs no praise ,
1799,wilt thou be dumb ?
1800,Excuse not silence so ,
1801,for ' t lies in thee To make him much outlive a gilded tomb And to be prais 'd of ages yet to be .
1802,Then do thy office ,
1803,Muse ;
1804,I teach thee how To make him seem long hence as he shows now .
1805,CII My love is strengthen 'd ,
1806,though more weak in seeming ;
1807,I love not less ,
1808,though less the show appear ;
1809,That love is merchandiz 'd ,
1810,whose rich esteeming ,
1811,The owner 's tongue doth publish every where .
1812,Our love was new ,
1813,and then but in the spring ,
1814,When I was wont to greet it with my lays ;
1815,As Philomel in summer 's front doth sing ,
1816,And stops her pipe in growth of riper days :
1817,Not that the summer is less pleasant now Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night ,
1818,But that wild music burthens every bough ,
1819,And sweets grown common lose their dear delight .
1820,Therefore like her ,
1821,I sometime hold my tongue :
1822,Because I would not dull you with my song .
1823,CIII Alack !
1824,what poverty my Muse brings forth ,
1825,That having such a scope to show her pride ,
1826,The argument ,
1827,all bare ,
1828,is of more worth Than when it hath my added praise beside !
1829,O !
1830,blame me not ,
1831,if I no more can write !
1832,Look in your glass ,
1833,and there appears a face That over-goes my blunt invention quite ,
1834,Dulling my lines ,
1835,and doing me disgrace .
1836,Were it not sinful then ,
1837,striving to mend ,
1838,To mar the subject that before was well ?
1839,For to no other pass my verses tend Than of your graces and your gifts to tell ;
1840,And more ,
1841,much more ,
1842,than in my verse can sit ,
1843,Your own glass shows you when you look in it .
1844,CIV To me ,
1845,fair friend ,
1846,you never can be old ,
1847,For as you were when first your eye I ey 'd ,
1848,Such seems your beauty still .
1849,Three winters cold ,
1850,Have from the forests shook three summers ' pride ,
1851,Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn 'd ,
1852,In process of the seasons have I seen ,
1853,Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn 'd ,
1854,Since first I saw you fresh ,
1855,which yet are green .
1856,Ah !
1857,yet doth beauty like a dial-hand ,
1858,Steal from his figure ,
1859,and no pace perceiv 'd ;
1860,So your sweet hue ,
1861,which methinks still doth stand ,
1862,Hath motion ,
1863,and mine eye may be deceiv 'd :
1864,For fear of which ,
1865,hear this thou age unbred :
1866,Ere you were born was beauty 's summer dead .
1867,CV Let not my love be call 'd idolatry ,
1868,Nor my beloved as an idol show ,
1869,Since all alike my songs and praises be To one ,
1870,of one ,
1871,still such ,
1872,and ever so .
1873,Kind is my love to-day ,
1874,to-morrow kind ,
1875,Still constant in a wondrous excellence ;
1876,Therefore my verse to constancy confin 'd ,
1877,One thing expressing ,
1878,leaves out difference .
1879,` Fair ,
1880,kind ,
1881,and true , '
1882,is all my argument ,
1883,` Fair ,
1884,kind ,
1885,and true , '
1886,varying to other words ;
1887,And in this change is my invention spent ,
1888,Three themes in one ,
1889,which wondrous scope affords .
1890,Fair ,
1891,kind ,
1892,and true ,
1893,have often liv 'd alone ,
1894,Which three till now ,
1895,never kept seat in one .
1896,CVI When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions of the fairest wights ,
1897,And beauty making beautiful old rime ,
1898,In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights ,
1899,Then ,
1900,in the blazon of sweet beauty 's best ,
1901,Of hand ,
1902,of foot ,
1903,of lip ,
1904,of eye ,
1905,of brow ,
1906,I see their antique pen would have express 'd Even such a beauty as you master now .
1907,So all their praises are but prophecies Of this our time ,
1908,all you prefiguring ;
1909,And for they looked but with divining eyes ,
1910,They had not skill enough your worth to sing :
1911,For we ,
1912,which now behold these present days ,
1913,Have eyes to wonder ,
1914,but lack tongues to praise .
1915,CVII Not mine own fears ,
1916,nor the prophetic soul Of the wide world dreaming on things to come ,
1917,Can yet the lease of my true love control ,
1918,Supposed as forfeit to a confin 'd doom .
1919,The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur 'd ,
1920,And the sad augurs mock their own presage ;
1921,Incertainties now crown themselves assur 'd ,
1922,And peace proclaims olives of endless age .
1923,Now with the drops of this most balmy time ,
1924,My love looks fresh ,
1925,and Death to me subscribes ,
1926,Since ,
1927,spite of him ,
1928,I 'll live in this poor rime ,
1929,While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes :
1930,And thou in this shalt find thy monument ,
1931,When tyrants ' crests and tombs of brass are spent .
1932,CVIII What 's in the brain ,
1933,that ink may character ,
1934,Which hath not figur 'd to thee my true spirit ?
1935,What 's new to speak ,
1936,what now to register ,
1937,That may express my love ,
1938,or thy dear merit ?
1939,Nothing ,
1940,sweet boy ;
1941,but yet ,
1942,like prayers divine ,
1943,I must each day say o'er the very same ;
1944,Counting no old thing old ,
1945,thou mine ,
1946,I thine ,
1947,Even as when first I hallow 'd thy fair name .
1948,So that eternal love in love 's fresh case ,
1949,Weighs not the dust and injury of age ,
1950,Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place ,
1951,But makes antiquity for aye his page ;
1952,Finding the first conceit of love there bred ,
1953,Where time and outward form would show it dead .
1954,CIX O !
1955,never say that I was false of heart ,
1956,Though absence seem 'd my flame to qualify ,
1957,As easy might I from my self depart As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie :
1958,That is my home of love :
1959,if I have rang 'd ,
1960,Like him that travels ,
1961,I return again ;
1962,Just to the time ,
1963,not with the time exchang 'd ,
1964,So that myself bring water for my stain .
1965,Never believe though in my nature reign 'd ,
1966,All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood ,
1967,That it could so preposterously be stain 'd ,
1968,To leave for nothing all thy sum of good ;
1969,For nothing this wide universe I call ,
1970,Save thou ,
1971,my rose ,
1972,in it thou art my all .
1973,CX Alas !
1974,` tis true ,
1975,I have gone here and there ,
1976,And made my self a motley to the view ,
1977,Gor 'd mine own thoughts ,
1978,sold cheap what is most dear ,
1979,Made old offences of affections new ;
1980,Most true it is ,
1981,that I have look 'd on truth Askance and strangely ;
1982,but ,
1983,by all above ,
1984,These blenches gave my heart another youth ,
1985,And worse essays prov 'd thee my best of love .
1986,Now all is done ,
1987,save what shall have no end :
1988,Mine appetite I never more will grind On newer proof ,
1989,to try an older friend ,
1990,A god in love ,
1991,to whom I am confin 'd .
1992,Then give me welcome ,
1993,next my heaven the best ,
1994,Even to thy pure and most most loving breast .
1995,CXI O !
1996,for my sake do you with Fortune chide ,
1997,The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds ,
1998,That did not better for my life provide Than public means which public manners breeds .
1999,Thence comes it that my name receives a brand ,
2000,And almost thence my nature is subdu 'd To what it works in ,
2001,like the dyer 's hand :
2002,Pity me ,
2003,then ,
2004,and wish I were renew 'd ;
2005,Whilst ,
2006,like a willing patient ,
2007,I will drink ,
2008,Potions of eisel ` gainst my strong infection ;
2009,No bitterness that I will bitter think ,
2010,Nor double penance ,
2011,to correct correction .
2012,Pity me then ,
2013,dear friend ,
2014,and I assure ye ,
2015,Even that your pity is enough to cure me .
2016,CXII Your love and pity doth the impression fill ,
2017,Which vulgar scandal stamp 'd upon my brow ;
2018,For what care I who calls me well or ill ,
2019,So you o'er-green my bad ,
2020,my good allow ?
2021,You are my all-the-world ,
2022,and I must strive To know my shames and praises from your tongue ;
2023,None else to me ,
2024,nor I to none alive ,
2025,That my steel 'd sense or changes right or wrong .
2026,In so profound abysm I throw all care Of others ' voices ,
2027,that my adder 's sense To critic and to flatterer stopped are .
2028,Mark how with my neglect I do dispense :
2029,You are so strongly in my purpose bred ,
2030,That all the world besides methinks are dead .
2031,CXIII Since I left you ,
2032,mine eye is in my mind ;
2033,And that which governs me to go about Doth part his function and is partly blind ,
2034,Seems seeing ,
2035,but effectually is out ;
2036,For it no form delivers to the heart Of bird ,
2037,of flower ,
2038,or shape which it doth latch :
2039,Of his quick objects hath the mind no part ,
2040,Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch ;
2041,For if it see the rud ` st or gentlest sight ,
2042,The most sweet favour or deformed ` st creature ,
2043,The mountain or the sea ,
2044,the day or night :
2045,The crow ,
2046,or dove ,
2047,it shapes them to your feature .
2048,Incapable of more ,
2049,replete with you ,
2050,My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue .
2051,CXIV Or whether doth my mind ,
2052,being crown 'd with you ,
2053,Drink up the monarch 's plague ,
2054,this flattery ?
2055,Or whether shall I say ,
2056,mine eye saith true ,
2057,And that your love taught it this alchemy ,
2058,To make of monsters and things indigest Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble ,
2059,Creating every bad a perfect best ,
2060,As fast as objects to his beams assemble ?
2061,O !
2062,` tis the first ,
2063,` tis flattery in my seeing ,
2064,And my great mind most kingly drinks it up :
2065,Mine eye well knows what with his gust is ` greeing ,
2066,And to his palate doth prepare the cup :
2067,If it be poison 'd ,
2068,` tis the lesser sin That mine eye loves it and doth first begin .
2069,CXV Those lines that I before have writ do lie ,
2070,Even those that said I could not love you dearer :
2071,Yet then my judgment knew no reason why My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer .
2072,But reckoning Time ,
2073,whose million 'd accidents Creep in ` twixt vows ,
2074,and change decrees of kings ,
2075,Tan sacred beauty ,
2076,blunt the sharp ` st intents ,
2077,Divert strong minds to the course of altering things ;
2078,Alas !
2079,why fearing of Time 's tyranny ,
2080,Might I not then say ,
2081,` Now I love you best , '
2082,When I was certain o'er incertainty ,
2083,Crowning the present ,
2084,doubting of the rest ?
2085,Love is a babe ,
2086,then might I not say so ,
2087,To give full growth to that which still doth grow ?
2088,CXVI Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments .
2089,Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds ,
2090,Or bends with the remover to remove :
2091,O ,
2092,no !
2093,it is an ever-fixed mark ,
2094,That looks on tempests and is never shaken ;
2095,It is the star to every wandering bark ,
2096,Whose worth 's unknown ,
2097,although his height be taken .
2098,Love 's not Time 's fool ,
2099,though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle 's compass come ;
2100,Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks ,
2101,But bears it out even to the edge of doom .
2102,If this be error and upon me prov 'd ,
2103,I never writ ,
2104,nor no man ever lov 'd .
2105,CXVII Accuse me thus :
2106,that I have scanted all ,
2107,Wherein I should your great deserts repay ,
2108,Forgot upon your dearest love to call ,
2109,Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day ;
2110,That I have frequent been with unknown minds ,
2111,And given to time your own dear-purchas 'd right ;
2112,That I have hoisted sail to all the winds Which should transport me farthest from your sight .
2113,Book both my wilfulness and errors down ,
2114,And on just proof surmise ,
2115,accumulate ;
2116,Bring me within the level of your frown ,
2117,But shoot not at me in your waken 'd hate ;
2118,Since my appeal says I did strive to prove The constancy and virtue of your love .
2119,CXVIII Like as ,
2120,to make our appetite more keen ,
2121,With eager compounds we our palate urge ;
2122,As ,
2123,to prevent our maladies unseen ,
2124,We sicken to shun sickness when we purge ;
2125,Even so ,
2126,being full of your ne'er - cloying sweetness ,
2127,To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding ;
2128,And ,
2129,sick of welfare ,
2130,found a kind of meetness To be diseas 'd ,
2131,ere that there was true needing .
2132,Thus policy in love ,
2133,to anticipate The ills that were not ,
2134,grew to faults assur 'd ,
2135,And brought to medicine a healthful state Which ,
2136,rank of goodness ,
2137,would by ill be cur 'd ;
2138,But thence I learn and find the lesson true ,
2139,Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you .
2140,CXIX What potions have I drunk of Siren tears ,
2141,Distill 'd from limbecks foul as hell within ,
2142,Applying fears to hopes ,
2143,and hopes to fears ,
2144,Still losing when I saw myself to win !
2145,What wretched errors hath my heart committed ,
2146,Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never !
2147,How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted ,
2148,In the distraction of this madding fever !
2149,O benefit of ill !
2150,now I find true That better is ,
2151,by evil still made better ;
2152,And ruin 'd love ,
2153,when it is built anew ,
2154,Grows fairer than at first ,
2155,more strong ,
2156,far greater .
2157,So I return rebuk 'd to my content ,
2158,And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent .
2159,CXX That you were once unkind befriends me now ,
2160,And for that sorrow ,
2161,which I then did feel ,
2162,Needs must I under my transgression bow ,
2163,Unless my nerves were brass or hammer 'd steel .
2164,For if you were by my unkindness shaken ,
2165,As I by yours ,
2166,you 've pass 'd a hell of time ;
2167,And I ,
2168,a tyrant ,
2169,have no leisure taken To weigh how once I suffer 'd in your crime .
2170,O !
2171,that our night of woe might have remember 'd My deepest sense ,
2172,how hard true sorrow hits ,
2173,And soon to you ,
2174,as you to me ,
2175,then tender 'd The humble salve ,
2176,which wounded bosoms fits !
2177,But that your trespass now becomes a fee ;
2178,Mine ransoms yours ,
2179,and yours must ransom me .
2180,CXXI ` Tis better to be vile than vile esteem 'd ,
2181,When not to be receives reproach of being ;
2182,And the just pleasure lost ,
2183,which is so deem 'd Not by our feeling ,
2184,but by others ' seeing :
2185,For why should others ' false adulterate eyes Give salutation to my sportive blood ?
2186,Or on my frailties why are frailer spies ,
2187,Which in their wills count bad what I think good ?
2188,No ,
2189,I am that I am ,
2190,and they that level At my abuses reckon up their own :
2191,I may be straight though they themselves be bevel ;
2192,By their rank thoughts ,
2193,my deeds must not be shown ;
2194,Unless this general evil they maintain ,
2195,All men are bad and in their badness reign .
2196,CXXII Thy gift ,
2197,thy tables ,
2198,are within my brain Full character 'd with lasting memory ,
2199,Which shall above that idle rank remain ,
2200,Beyond all date ;
2201,even to eternity :
2202,Or ,
2203,at the least ,
2204,so long as brain and heart Have faculty by nature to subsist ;
2205,Till each to raz 'd oblivion yield his part Of thee ,
2206,thy record never can be miss 'd .
2207,That poor retention could not so much hold ,
2208,Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score ;
2209,Therefore to give them from me was I bold ,
2210,To trust those tables that receive thee more :
2211,To keep an adjunct to remember thee Were to import forgetfulness in me .
2212,CXXIII No ,
2213,Time ,
2214,thou shalt not boast that I do change :
2215,Thy pyramids built up with newer might To me are nothing novel ,
2216,nothing strange ;
2217,They are but dressings of a former sight .
2218,Our dates are brief ,
2219,and therefore we admire What thou dost foist upon us that is old ;
2220,And rather make them born to our desire Than think that we before have heard them told .
2221,Thy registers and thee I both defy ,
2222,Not wondering at the present nor the past ,
2223,For thy records and what we see doth lie ,
2224,Made more or less by thy continual haste .
2225,This I do vow and this shall ever be ;
2226,I will be true despite thy scythe and thee .
2227,CXXIV If my dear love were but the child of state ,
2228,It might for Fortune 's bastard be unfather 'd ,
2229,As subject to Time 's love or to Time 's hate ,
2230,Weeds among weeds ,
2231,or flowers with flowers gather 'd .
2232,No ,
2233,it was builded far from accident ;
2234,It suffers not in smiling pomp ,
2235,nor falls Under the blow of thralled discontent ,
2236,Whereto th ' inviting time our fashion calls :
2237,It fears not policy ,
2238,that heretic ,
2239,Which works on leases of short-number 'd hours ,
2240,But all alone stands hugely politic ,
2241,That it nor grows with heat ,
2242,nor drowns with showers .
2243,To this I witness call the fools of time ,
2244,Which die for goodness ,
2245,who have lived for crime .
2246,CXXV Were ' t aught to me I bore the canopy ,
2247,With my extern the outward honouring ,
2248,Or laid great bases for eternity ,
2249,Which proves more short than waste or ruining ?
2250,Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour Lose all and more by paying too much rent For compound sweet ;
2251,forgoing simple savour ,
2252,Pitiful thrivers ,
2253,in their gazing spent ?
2254,No ;
2255,let me be obsequious in thy heart ,
2256,And take thou my oblation ,
2257,poor but free ,
2258,Which is not mix 'd with seconds ,
2259,knows no art ,
2260,But mutual render ,
2261,only me for thee .
2262,Hence ,
2263,thou suborned informer !
2264,a true soul When most impeach 'd ,
2265,stands least in thy control .
2266,CXXVI O thou ,
2267,my lovely boy ,
2268,who in thy power Dost hold Time 's fickle glass ,
2269,his fickle hour ;
2270,Who hast by waning grown ,
2271,and therein show ` st Thy lovers withering ,
2272,as thy sweet self grow ` st. If Nature ,
2273,sovereign mistress over wrack ,
2274,As thou goest onwards ,
2275,still will pluck thee back ,
2276,She keeps thee to this purpose ,
2277,that her skill May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill .
2278,Yet fear her ,
2279,O thou minion of her pleasure !
2280,She may detain ,
2281,but not still keep ,
2282,her treasure :
2283,Her audit -LRB- though delayed -RRB- answered must be ,
2284,And her quietus is to render thee .
2285,CXXVII In the old age black was not counted fair ,
2286,Or if it were ,
2287,it bore not beauty 's name ;
2288,But now is black beauty 's successive heir ,
2289,And beauty slander 'd with a bastard shame :
2290,For since each hand hath put on Nature 's power ,
2291,Fairing the foul with Art 's false borrowed face ,
2292,Sweet beauty hath no name ,
2293,no holy bower ,
2294,But is profan 'd ,
2295,if not lives in disgrace .
2296,Therefore my mistress ' eyes are raven black ,
2297,Her eyes so suited ,
2298,and they mourners seem At such who ,
2299,not born fair ,
2300,no beauty lack ,
2301,Sland ` ring creation with a false esteem :
2302,Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe ,
2303,That every tongue says beauty should look so .
2304,CXXVIII How oft when thou ,
2305,my music ,
2306,music play ` st ,
2307,Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway ` st The wiry concord that mine ear confounds ,
2308,Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap ,
2309,To kiss the tender inward of thy hand ,
2310,Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap ,
2311,At the wood 's boldness by thee blushing stand !
2312,To be so tickled ,
2313,they would change their state And situation with those dancing chips ,
2314,O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait ,
2315,Making dead wood more bless 'd than living lips .
2316,Since saucy jacks so happy are in this ,
2317,Give them thy fingers ,
2318,me thy lips to kiss .
2319,CXXIX The expense of spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action :
2320,and till action ,
2321,lust Is perjur 'd ,
2322,murderous ,
2323,bloody ,
2324,full of blame ,
2325,Savage ,
2326,extreme ,
2327,rude ,
2328,cruel ,
2329,not to trust ;
2330,Enjoy 'd no sooner but despised straight ;
2331,Past reason hunted ;
2332,and no sooner had ,
2333,Past reason hated ,
2334,as a swallow 'd bait ,
2335,On purpose laid to make the taker mad :
2336,Mad in pursuit and in possession so ;
2337,Had ,
2338,having ,
2339,and in quest ,
2340,to have extreme ;
2341,A bliss in proof ,
2342,-- and prov 'd ,
2343,a very woe ;
2344,Before ,
2345,a joy propos 'd ;
2346,behind a dream .
2347,All this the world well knows ;
2348,yet none knows well To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell .
2349,CXXX My mistress ' eyes are nothing like the sun ;
2350,Coral is far more red ,
2351,than her lips red :
2352,If snow be white ,
2353,why then her breasts are dun ;
2354,If hairs be wires ,
2355,black wires grow on her head .
2356,I have seen roses damask 'd ,
2357,red and white ,
2358,But no such roses see I in her cheeks ;
2359,And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks .
2360,I love to hear her speak ,
2361,yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound :
2362,I grant I never saw a goddess go ,
2363,-- My mistress ,
2364,when she walks ,
2365,treads on the ground :
2366,And yet by heaven ,
2367,I think my love as rare ,
2368,As any she belied with false compare .
2369,CXXXI Thou art as tyrannous ,
2370,so as thou art ,
2371,As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel ;
2372,For well thou know ` st to my dear doting heart Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel .
2373,Yet ,
2374,in good faith ,
2375,some say that thee behold ,
2376,Thy face hath not the power to make love groan ;
2377,To say they err I dare not be so bold ,
2378,Although I swear it to myself alone .
2379,And to be sure that is not false I swear ,
2380,A thousand groans ,
2381,but thinking on thy face ,
2382,One on another 's neck ,
2383,do witness bear Thy black is fairest in my judgment 's place .
2384,In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds ,
2385,And thence this slander ,
2386,as I think ,
2387,proceeds .
2388,CXXXII Thine eyes I love ,
2389,and they ,
2390,as pitying me ,
2391,Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain ,
2392,Have put on black and loving mourners be ,
2393,Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain .
2394,And truly not the morning sun of heaven Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east ,
2395,Nor that full star that ushers in the even ,
2396,Doth half that glory to the sober west ,
2397,As those two mourning eyes become thy face :
2398,O !
2399,let it then as well beseem thy heart To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace ,
2400,And suit thy pity like in every part .
2401,Then will I swear beauty herself is black ,
2402,And all they foul that thy complexion lack .
2403,CXXXIII Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan For that deep wound it gives my friend and me !
2404,Is ' t not enough to torture me alone ,
2405,But slave to slavery my sweet ` st friend must be ?
2406,Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken ,
2407,And my next self thou harder hast engross 'd :
2408,Of him ,
2409,myself ,
2410,and thee I am forsaken ;
2411,A torment thrice three-fold thus to be cross 'd :
2412,Prison my heart in thy steel bosom 's ward ,
2413,But then my friend 's heart let my poor heart bail ;
2414,Whoe'er keeps me ,
2415,let my heart be his guard ;
2416,Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail :
2417,And yet thou wilt ;
2418,for I ,
2419,being pent in thee ,
2420,Perforce am thine ,
2421,and all that is in me .
2422,CXXXIV So ,
2423,now I have confess 'd that he is thine ,
2424,And I my self am mortgag 'd to thy will ,
2425,Myself I 'll forfeit ,
2426,so that other mine Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still :
2427,But thou wilt not ,
2428,nor he will not be free ,
2429,For thou art covetous ,
2430,and he is kind ;
2431,He learn 'd but surety-like to write for me ,
2432,Under that bond that him as fast doth bind .
2433,The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take ,
2434,Thou usurer ,
2435,that putt ` st forth all to use ,
2436,And sue a friend came debtor for my sake ;
2437,So him I lose through my unkind abuse .
2438,Him have I lost ;
2439,thou hast both him and me :
2440,He pays the whole ,
2441,and yet am I not free .
2442,CXXXV Whoever hath her wish ,
2443,thou hast thy ` Will , '
2444,And ` Will ' to boot ,
2445,and ` Will ' in over-plus ;
2446,More than enough am I that vex 'd thee still ,
2447,To thy sweet will making addition thus .
2448,Wilt thou ,
2449,whose will is large and spacious ,
2450,Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine ?
2451,Shall will in others seem right gracious ,
2452,And in my will no fair acceptance shine ?
2453,The sea ,
2454,all water ,
2455,yet receives rain still ,
2456,And in abundance addeth to his store ;
2457,So thou ,
2458,being rich in ` Will , '
2459,add to thy ` Will ' One will of mine ,
2460,to make thy large will more .
2461,Let no unkind ` No ' fair beseechers kill ;
2462,Think all but one ,
2463,and me in that one ` Will . '
2464,CXXXVI If thy soul check thee that I come so near ,
2465,Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy ` Will ' ,
2466,And will ,
2467,thy soul knows ,
2468,is admitted there ;
2469,Thus far for love ,
2470,my love-suit ,
2471,sweet ,
2472,fulfil .
2473,` Will ' ,
2474,will fulfil the treasure of thy love ,
2475,Ay ,
2476,fill it full with wills ,
2477,and my will one .
2478,In things of great receipt with ease we prove Among a number one is reckon 'd none :
2479,Then in the number let me pass untold ,
2480,Though in thy store 's account I one must be ;
2481,For nothing hold me ,
2482,so it please thee hold That nothing me ,
2483,a something sweet to thee :
2484,Make but my name thy love ,
2485,and love that still ,
2486,And then thou lov ` st me for my name is ` Will . '
2487,CXXXVII Thou blind fool ,
2488,Love ,
2489,what dost thou to mine eyes ,
2490,That they behold ,
2491,and see not what they see ?
2492,They know what beauty is ,
2493,see where it lies ,
2494,Yet what the best is take the worst to be .
2495,If eyes ,
2496,corrupt by over-partial looks ,
2497,Be anchor 'd in the bay where all men ride ,
2498,Why of eyes ' falsehood hast thou forged hooks ,
2499,Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied ?
2500,Why should my heart think that a several plot ,
2501,Which my heart knows the wide world 's common place ?
2502,Or mine eyes ,
2503,seeing this ,
2504,say this is not ,
2505,To put fair truth upon so foul a face ?
2506,In things right true my heart and eyes have err 'd ,
2507,And to this false plague are they now transferr 'd .
2508,CXXXVIII When my love swears that she is made of truth ,
2509,I do believe her though I know she lies ,
2510,That she might think me some untutor 'd youth ,
2511,Unlearned in the world 's false subtleties .
2512,Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young ,
2513,Although she knows my days are past the best ,
2514,Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue :
2515,On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed :
2516,But wherefore says she not she is unjust ?
2517,And wherefore say not I that I am old ?
2518,O !
2519,love 's best habit is in seeming trust ,
2520,And age in love ,
2521,loves not to have years told :
2522,Therefore I lie with her ,
2523,and she with me ,
2524,And in our faults by lies we flatter 'd be .
2525,CXXXIX O !
2526,call not me to justify the wrong That thy unkindness lays upon my heart ;
2527,Wound me not with thine eye ,
2528,but with thy tongue :
2529,Use power with power ,
2530,and slay me not by art ,
2531,Tell me thou lov ` st elsewhere ;
2532,but in my sight ,
2533,Dear heart ,
2534,forbear to glance thine eye aside :
2535,What need ` st thou wound with cunning ,
2536,when thy might Is more than my o'erpress 'd defence can bide ?
2537,Let me excuse thee :
2538,ah !
2539,my love well knows Her pretty looks have been mine enemies ;
2540,And therefore from my face she turns my foes ,
2541,That they elsewhere might dart their injuries :
2542,Yet do not so ;
2543,but since I am near slain ,
2544,Kill me outright with looks ,
2545,and rid my pain .
2546,CXL Be wise as thou art cruel ;
2547,do not press My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain ;
2548,Lest sorrow lend me words ,
2549,and words express The manner of my pity-wanting pain .
2550,If I might teach thee wit ,
2551,better it were ,
2552,Though not to love ,
2553,yet ,
2554,love to tell me so ;
2555,-- As testy sick men ,
2556,when their deaths be near ,
2557,No news but health from their physicians know ;
2558,-- For ,
2559,if I should despair ,
2560,I should grow mad ,
2561,And in my madness might speak ill of thee ;
2562,Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad ,
2563,Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be .
2564,That I may not be so ,
2565,nor thou belied ,
2566,Bear thine eyes straight ,
2567,though thy proud heart go wide .
2568,CXLI In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes ,
2569,For they in thee a thousand errors note ;
2570,But ` tis my heart that loves what they despise ,
2571,Who ,
2572,in despite of view ,
2573,is pleased to dote .
2574,Nor are mine ears with thy tongue 's tune delighted ;
2575,Nor tender feeling ,
2576,to base touches prone ,
2577,Nor taste ,
2578,nor smell ,
2579,desire to be invited To any sensual feast with thee alone :
2580,But my five wits nor my five senses can Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee ,
2581,Who leaves unsway 'd the likeness of a man ,
2582,Thy proud heart 's slave and vassal wretch to be :
2583,Only my plague thus far I count my gain ,
2584,That she that makes me sin awards me pain .
2585,CXLII Love is my sin ,
2586,and thy dear virtue hate ,
2587,Hate of my sin ,
2588,grounded on sinful loving :
2589,O !
2590,but with mine compare thou thine own state ,
2591,And thou shalt find it merits not reproving ;
2592,Or ,
2593,if it do ,
2594,not from those lips of thine ,
2595,That have profan 'd their scarlet ornaments And seal 'd false bonds of love as oft as mine ,
2596,Robb 'd others ' beds ' revenues of their rents .
2597,Be it lawful I love thee ,
2598,as thou lov ` st those Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee :
2599,Root pity in thy heart ,
2600,that ,
2601,when it grows ,
2602,Thy pity may deserve to pitied be .
2603,If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide ,
2604,By self-example mayst thou be denied !
2605,CXLIII Lo ,
2606,as a careful housewife runs to catch One of her feather 'd creatures broke away ,
2607,Sets down her babe ,
2608,and makes all swift dispatch In pursuit of the thing she would have stay ;
2609,Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase ,
2610,Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent To follow that which flies before her face ,
2611,Not prizing her poor infant 's discontent ;
2612,So runn ` st thou after that which flies from thee ,
2613,Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind ;
2614,But if thou catch thy hope ,
2615,turn back to me ,
2616,And play the mother 's part ,
2617,kiss me ,
2618,be kind ;
2619,So will I pray that thou mayst have thy ` Will , '
2620,If thou turn back and my loud crying still .
2621,CXLIV Two loves I have of comfort and despair ,
2622,Which like two spirits do suggest me still :
2623,The better angel is a man right fair ,
2624,The worser spirit a woman colour 'd ill .
2625,To win me soon to hell ,
2626,my female evil ,
2627,Tempteth my better angel from my side ,
2628,And would corrupt my saint to be a devil ,
2629,Wooing his purity with her foul pride .
2630,And whether that my angel be turn 'd fiend ,
2631,Suspect I may ,
2632,yet not directly tell ;
2633,But being both from me ,
2634,both to each friend ,
2635,I guess one angel in another 's hell :
2636,Yet this shall I ne'er know ,
2637,but live in doubt ,
2638,Till my bad angel fire my good one out .
2639,CXLV Those lips that Love 's own hand did make ,
2640,Breathed forth the sound that said ' I hate ' ,
2641,To me that languish 'd for her sake :
2642,But when she saw my woeful state ,
2643,Straight in her heart did mercy come ,
2644,Chiding that tongue that ever sweet Was us 'd in giving gentle doom ;
2645,And taught it thus anew to greet ; '
2646,I hate ' she alter 'd with an end ,
2647,That followed it as gentle day ,
2648,Doth follow night ,
2649,who like a fiend From heaven to hell is flown away . '
2650,I hate ' ,
2651,from hate away she threw ,
2652,And sav 'd my life ,
2653,saying ` not you ' .
2654,CXLVI Poor soul ,
2655,the centre of my sinful earth ,
2656,My sinful earth these rebel powers array ,
2657,Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth ,
2658,Painting thy outward walls so costly gay ?
2659,Why so large cost ,
2660,having so short a lease ,
2661,Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend ?
2662,Shall worms ,
2663,inheritors of this excess ,
2664,Eat up thy charge ?
2665,Is this thy body 's end ?
2666,Then soul ,
2667,live thou upon thy servant 's loss ,
2668,And let that pine to aggravate thy store ;
2669,Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross ;
2670,Within be fed ,
2671,without be rich no more :
2672,So shall thou feed on Death ,
2673,that feeds on men ,
2674,And Death once dead ,
2675,there 's no more dying then .
2676,CXLVII My love is as a fever longing still ,
2677,For that which longer nurseth the disease ;
2678,Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill ,
2679,The uncertain sickly appetite to please .
2680,My reason ,
2681,the physician to my love ,
2682,Angry that his prescriptions are not kept ,
2683,Hath left me ,
2684,and I desperate now approve Desire is death ,
2685,which physic did except .
2686,Past cure I am ,
2687,now Reason is past care ,
2688,And frantic-mad with evermore unrest ;
2689,My thoughts and my discourse as madmen 's are ,
2690,At random from the truth vainly express 'd ;
2691,For I have sworn thee fair ,
2692,and thought thee bright ,
2693,Who art as black as hell ,
2694,as dark as night .
2695,CXLVIII O me !
2696,what eyes hath Love put in my head ,
2697,Which have no correspondence with true sight ;
2698,Or ,
2699,if they have ,
2700,where is my judgment fled ,
2701,That censures falsely what they see aright ?
2702,If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote ,
2703,What means the world to say it is not so ?
2704,If it be not ,
2705,then love doth well denote Love 's eye is not so true as all men 's :
2706,no ,
2707,How can it ?
2708,O !
2709,how can Love 's eye be true ,
2710,That is so vexed with watching and with tears ?
2711,No marvel then ,
2712,though I mistake my view ;
2713,The sun itself sees not ,
2714,till heaven clears .
2715,O cunning Love !
2716,with tears thou keep ` st me blind ,
2717,Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find .
2718,CXLIX Canst thou ,
2719,O cruel !
2720,say I love thee not ,
2721,When I against myself with thee partake ?
2722,Do I not think on thee ,
2723,when I forgot Am of my self ,
2724,all tyrant ,
2725,for thy sake ?
2726,Who hateth thee that I do call my friend ,
2727,On whom frown ` st thou that I do fawn upon ,
2728,Nay ,
2729,if thou lour ` st on me ,
2730,do I not spend Revenge upon myself with present moan ?
2731,What merit do I in my self respect ,
2732,That is so proud thy service to despise ,
2733,When all my best doth worship thy defect ,
2734,Commanded by the motion of thine eyes ?
2735,But ,
2736,love ,
2737,hate on ,
2738,for now I know thy mind ;
2739,Those that can see thou lov ` st ,
2740,and I am blind .
2741,CL O !
2742,from what power hast thou this powerful might ,
2743,With insufficiency my heart to sway ?
2744,To make me give the lie to my true sight ,
2745,And swear that brightness doth not grace the day ?
2746,Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill ,
2747,That in the very refuse of thy deeds There is such strength and warrantise of skill ,
2748,That ,
2749,in my mind ,
2750,thy worst all best exceeds ?
2751,Who taught thee how to make me love thee more ,
2752,The more I hear and see just cause of hate ?
2753,O !
2754,though I love what others do abhor ,
2755,With others thou shouldst not abhor my state :
2756,If thy unworthiness rais 'd love in me ,
2757,More worthy I to be belov 'd of thee .
2758,CLI Love is too young to know what conscience is ,
2759,Yet who knows not conscience is born of love ?
2760,Then ,
2761,gentle cheater ,
2762,urge not my amiss ,
2763,Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove :
2764,For ,
2765,thou betraying me ,
2766,I do betray My nobler part to my gross body 's treason ;
2767,My soul doth tell my body that he may Triumph in love ;
2768,flesh stays no farther reason ,
2769,But rising at thy name doth point out thee ,
2770,As his triumphant prize .
2771,Proud of this pride ,
2772,He is contented thy poor drudge to be ,
2773,To stand in thy affairs ,
2774,fall by thy side .
2775,No want of conscience hold it that I call Her ` love , '
2776,for whose dear love I rise and fall .
2777,CLII In loving thee thou know ` st I am forsworn ,
2778,But thou art twice forsworn ,
2779,to me love swearing ;
2780,In act thy bed-vow broke ,
2781,and new faith torn ,
2782,In vowing new hate after new love bearing :
2783,But why of two oaths ' breach do I accuse thee ,
2784,When I break twenty ?
2785,I am perjur 'd most ;
2786,For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee ,
2787,And all my honest faith in thee is lost :
2788,For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness ,
2789,Oaths of thy love ,
2790,thy truth ,
2791,thy constancy ;
2792,And ,
2793,to enlighten thee ,
2794,gave eyes to blindness ,
2795,Or made them swear against the thing they see ;
2796,For I have sworn thee fair ;
2797,more perjur 'd I ,
2798,To swear against the truth so foul a lie !
2799,CLIII Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep :
2800,A maid of Dian 's this advantage found ,
2801,And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep In a cold valley-fountain of that ground ;
2802,Which borrow 'd from this holy fire of Love ,
2803,A dateless lively heat ,
2804,still to endure ,
2805,And grew a seeting bath ,
2806,which yet men prove Against strange maladies a sovereign cure .
2807,But at my mistress ' eye Love 's brand new-fired ,
2808,The boy for trial needs would touch my breast ;
2809,I ,
2810,sick withal ,
2811,the help of bath desired ,
2812,And thither hied ,
2813,a sad distemper 'd guest ,
2814,But found no cure ,
2815,the bath for my help lies Where Cupid got new fire ;
2816,my mistress ' eyes .
2817,CLIV The little Love-god lying once asleep ,
2818,Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand ,
2819,Whilst many nymphs that vow 'd chaste life to keep Came tripping by ;
2820,but in her maiden hand The fairest votary took up that fire Which many legions of true hearts had warm 'd ;
2821,And so the general of hot desire Was ,
2822,sleeping ,
2823,by a virgin hand disarm 'd .
2824,This brand she quenched in a cool well by ,
2825,Which from Love 's fire took heat perpetual ,
2826,Growing a bath and healthful remedy ,
2827,For men diseas 'd ;
2828,but I ,
2829,my mistress ' thrall ,
2830,Came there for cure and this by that I prove ,
2831,Love 's fire heats water ,
2832,water cools not love .
