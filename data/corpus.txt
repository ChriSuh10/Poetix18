1,From fairest creatures we desire increase ,
2,That thereby beauty 's rose might never die ,
3,But as the riper should by time decease ,
4,His tender heir might bear his memory :
5,But thou , contracted to thine own bright eyes ,
6,Feed ` st thy light 's flame with self-substantial fuel ,
7,Making a famine where abundance lies ,
8,Thy self thy foe , to thy sweet self too cruel :
9,Thou that art now the world 's fresh ornament ,
10,And only herald to the gaudy spring ,
11,Within thine own bud buriest thy content ,
12,And tender churl mak ` st waste in niggarding :
13,Pity the world , or else this glutton be ,
14,To eat the world 's due , by the grave and thee .
15,II
16,When forty winters shall besiege thy brow ,
17,And dig deep trenches in thy beauty 's field ,
18,Thy youth 's proud livery so gazed on now ,
19,Will be a tatter 'd weed of small worth held :
20,Then being asked , where all thy beauty lies ,
21,Where all the treasure of thy lusty days ;
22,To say , within thine own deep sunken eyes ,
23,Were an all-eating shame , and thriftless praise .
24,How much more praise deserv 'd thy beauty 's use ,
25,If thou couldst answer ` This fair child of mine
26,Shall sum my count , and make my old excuse , '
27,Proving his beauty by succession thine !
28,This were to be new made when thou art old ,
29,And see thy blood warm when thou feel ` st it cold .
30,III
31,Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
32,Now is the time that face should form another ;
33,Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest ,
34,Thou dost beguile the world , unbless some mother .
35,For where is she so fair whose unear 'd womb
36,Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry ?
37,Or who is he so fond will be the tomb ,
38,Of his self-love to stop posterity ?
39,Thou art thy mother 's glass and she in thee
40,Calls back the lovely April of her prime ;
41,So thou through windows of thine age shalt see ,
42,Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time .
43,But if thou live , remember 'd not to be ,
44,Die single and thine image dies with thee .
45,IV
46,Unthrifty loveliness , why dost thou spend
47,Upon thy self thy beauty 's legacy ?
48,Nature 's bequest gives nothing , but doth lend ,
49,And being frank she lends to those are free :
50,Then , beauteous niggard , why dost thou abuse
51,The bounteous largess given thee to give ?
52,Profitless usurer , why dost thou use
53,So great a sum of sums , yet canst not live ?
54,For having traffic with thy self alone ,
55,Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive :
56,Then how when nature calls thee to be gone ,
57,What acceptable audit canst thou leave ?
58,Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee ,
59,Which , used , lives th ' executor to be .
60,V
61,Those hours , that with gentle work did frame
62,The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell ,
63,Will play the tyrants to the very same
64,And that unfair which fairly doth excel ;
65,For never-resting time leads summer on
66,To hideous winter , and confounds him there ;
67,Sap checked with frost , and lusty leaves quite gone ,
68,Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where :
69,Then were not summer 's distillation left ,
70,A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass ,
71,Beauty 's effect with beauty were bereft ,
72,Nor it , nor no remembrance what it was :
73,But flowers distill 'd , though they with winter meet ,
74,Leese but their show ; their substance still lives sweet .
75,VI
76,Then let not winter 's ragged hand deface ,
77,In thee thy summer , ere thou be distill 'd :
78,Make sweet some vial ; treasure thou some place
79,With beauty 's treasure ere it be self-kill 'd .
80,That use is not forbidden usury ,
81,Which happies those that pay the willing loan ;
82,That 's for thy self to breed another thee ,
83,Or ten times happier , be it ten for one ;
84,Ten times thy self were happier than thou art ,
85,If ten of thine ten times refigur 'd thee :
86,Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart ,
87,Leaving thee living in posterity ?
88,Be not self-will 'd , for thou art much too fair
89,To be death 's conquest and make worms thine heir .
90,VII
91,Lo ! in the orient when the gracious light
92,Lifts up his burning head , each under eye
93,Doth homage to his new-appearing sight ,
94,Serving with looks his sacred majesty ;
95,And having climb 'd the steep-up heavenly hill ,
96,Resembling strong youth in his middle age ,
97,Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still ,
98,Attending on his golden pilgrimage :
99,But when from highmost pitch , with weary car ,
100,Like feeble age , he reeleth from the day ,
101,The eyes , ` fore duteous , now converted are
102,From his low tract , and look another way :
103,So thou , thyself outgoing in thy noon :
104,Unlook 'd , on diest unless thou get a son .
105,VIII
106,Music to hear , why hear ` st thou music sadly ?
107,Sweets with sweets war not , joy delights in joy :
108,Why lov ` st thou that which thou receiv ` st not gladly ,
109,Or else receiv ` st with pleasure thine annoy ?
110,If the true concord of well-tuned sounds ,
111,By unions married , do offend thine ear ,
112,They do but sweetly chide thee , who confounds
113,In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear .
114,Mark how one string , sweet husband to another ,
115,Strikes each in each by mutual ordering ;
116,Resembling sire and child and happy mother ,
117,Who , all in one , one pleasing note do sing :
118,Whose speechless song being many , seeming one ,
119,Sings this to thee : ` Thou single wilt prove none . '
120,IX
121,Is it for fear to wet a widow 's eye ,
122,That thou consum ` st thy self in single life ?
123,Ah ! if thou issueless shalt hap to die ,
124,The world will wail thee like a makeless wife ;
125,The world will be thy widow and still weep
126,That thou no form of thee hast left behind ,
127,When every private widow well may keep
128,By children 's eyes , her husband 's shape in mind :
129,Look ! what an unthrift in the world doth spend
130,Shifts but his place , for still the world enjoys it ;
131,But beauty 's waste hath in the world an end ,
132,And kept unused the user so destroys it .
133,No love toward others in that bosom sits
134,That on himself such murd ` rous shame commits .
135,X
136,For shame ! deny that thou bear ` st love to any ,
137,Who for thy self art so unprovident .
138,Grant , if thou wilt , thou art belov 'd of many ,
139,But that thou none lov ` st is most evident :
140,For thou art so possess 'd with murderous hate ,
141,That ` gainst thy self thou stick ` st not to conspire ,
142,Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
143,Which to repair should be thy chief desire .
144,O ! change thy thought , that I may change my mind :
145,Shall hate be fairer lodg 'd than gentle love ?
146,Be , as thy presence is , gracious and kind ,
147,Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove :
148,Make thee another self for love of me ,
149,That beauty still may live in thine or thee .
150,XI
151,As fast as thou shalt wane , so fast thou grow ` st ,
152,In one of thine , from that which thou departest ;
153,And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow ` st ,
154,Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest ,
155,Herein lives wisdom , beauty , and increase ;
156,Without this folly , age , and cold decay :
157,If all were minded so , the times should cease
158,And threescore year would make the world away .
159,Let those whom nature hath not made for store ,
160,Harsh , featureless , and rude , barrenly perish :
161,Look , whom she best endow 'd , she gave thee more ;
162,Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish :
163,She carv 'd thee for her seal , and meant thereby ,
164,Thou shouldst print more , not let that copy die .
165,XII
166,When I do count the clock that tells the time ,
167,And see the brave day sunk in hideous night ;
168,When I behold the violet past prime ,
169,And sable curls , all silvered o'er with white ;
170,When lofty trees I see barren of leaves ,
171,Which erst from heat did canopy the herd ,
172,And summer 's green all girded up in sheaves ,
173,Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard ,
174,Then of thy beauty do I question make ,
175,That thou among the wastes of time must go ,
176,Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
177,And die as fast as they see others grow ;
178,And nothing ` gainst Time 's scythe can make defence
179,Save breed , to brave him when he takes thee hence .
180,XIII
181,O ! that you were your self ; but , love you are
182,No longer yours , than you your self here live :
183,Against this coming end you should prepare ,
184,And your sweet semblance to some other give :
185,So should that beauty which you hold in lease
186,Find no determination ; then you were
187,Yourself again , after yourself 's decease ,
188,When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear .
189,Who lets so fair a house fall to decay ,
190,Which husbandry in honour might uphold ,
191,Against the stormy gusts of winter 's day
192,And barren rage of death 's eternal cold ?
193,O ! none but unthrifts . Dear my love , you know ,
194,You had a father : let your son say so .
195,XIV
196,Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck ;
197,And yet methinks I have astronomy ,
198,But not to tell of good or evil luck ,
199,Of plagues , of dearths , or seasons ' quality ;
200,Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell ,
201,Pointing to each his thunder , rain and wind ,
202,Or say with princes if it shall go well
203,By oft predict that I in heaven find :
204,But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive ,
205,And constant stars in them I read such art
206,As ` Truth and beauty shall together thrive ,
207,If from thyself , to store thou wouldst convert ' ;
208,Or else of thee this I prognosticate :
209,` Thy end is truth 's and beauty 's doom and date . '
210,XV
211,When I consider every thing that grows
212,Holds in perfection but a little moment ,
213,That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
214,Whereon the stars in secret influence comment ;
215,When I perceive that men as plants increase ,
216,Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky ,
217,Vaunt in their youthful sap , at height decrease ,
218,And wear their brave state out of memory ;
219,Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
220,Sets you most rich in youth before my sight ,
221,Where wasteful Time debateth with decay
222,To change your day of youth to sullied night ,
223,And all in war with Time for love of you ,
224,As he takes from you , I engraft you new .
225,XVI
226,But wherefore do not you a mightier way
227,Make war upon this bloody tyrant , Time ?
228,And fortify your self in your decay
229,With means more blessed than my barren rhyme ?
230,Now stand you on the top of happy hours ,
231,And many maiden gardens , yet unset ,
232,With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers ,
233,Much liker than your painted counterfeit :
234,So should the lines of life that life repair ,
235,Which this , Time 's pencil , or my pupil pen ,
236,Neither in inward worth nor outward fair ,
237,Can make you live your self in eyes of men .
238,To give away yourself , keeps yourself still ,
239,And you must live , drawn by your own sweet skill .
240,XVII
241,Who will believe my verse in time to come ,
242,If it were fill 'd with your most high deserts ?
243,Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
244,Which hides your life , and shows not half your parts .
245,If I could write the beauty of your eyes ,
246,And in fresh numbers number all your graces ,
247,The age to come would say ` This poet lies ;
248,Such heavenly touches ne'er touch 'd earthly faces . '
249,So should my papers , yellow 'd with their age ,
250,Be scorn 'd , like old men of less truth than tongue ,
251,And your true rights be term 'd a poet 's rage
252,And stretched metre of an antique song :
253,But were some child of yours alive that time ,
254,You should live twice , -- in it , and in my rhyme .
255,XVIII
256,Shall I compare thee to a summer 's day ?
257,Thou art more lovely and more temperate :
258,Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May ,
259,And summer 's lease hath all too short a date :
260,Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines ,
261,And often is his gold complexion dimm 'd ,
262,And every fair from fair sometime declines ,
263,By chance , or nature 's changing course untrimm 'd :
264,But thy eternal summer shall not fade ,
265,Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow ` st ,
266,Nor shall death brag thou wander ` st in his shade ,
267,When in eternal lines to time thou grow ` st ,
268,So long as men can breathe , or eyes can see ,
269,So long lives this , and this gives life to thee .
270,XIX
271,Devouring Time , blunt thou the lion 's paws ,
272,And make the earth devour her own sweet brood ;
273,Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger 's jaws ,
274,And burn the long-liv 'd phoenix , in her blood ;
275,Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets ,
276,And do whate'er thou wilt , swift-footed Time ,
277,To the wide world and all her fading sweets ;
278,But I forbid thee one most heinous crime :
279,O ! carve not with thy hours my love 's fair brow ,
280,Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen ;
281,Him in thy course untainted do allow
282,For beauty 's pattern to succeeding men .
283,Yet , do thy worst old Time : despite thy wrong ,
284,My love shall in my verse ever live young .
285,XX
286,A woman 's face with nature 's own hand painted ,
287,Hast thou , the master mistress of my passion ;
288,A woman 's gentle heart , but not acquainted
289,With shifting change , as is false women 's fashion :
290,An eye more bright than theirs , less false in rolling ,
291,Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth ;
292,A man in hue all ` hues ' in his controlling ,
293,Which steals men 's eyes and women 's souls amazeth .
294,And for a woman wert thou first created ;
295,Till Nature , as she wrought thee , fell a-doting ,
296,And by addition me of thee defeated ,
297,By adding one thing to my purpose nothing .
298,But since she prick 'd thee out for women 's pleasure ,
299,Mine be thy love and thy love 's use their treasure .
300,XXI
301,So is it not with me as with that Muse ,
302,Stirr 'd by a painted beauty to his verse ,
303,Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
304,And every fair with his fair doth rehearse ,
305,Making a couplement of proud compare .
306,With sun and moon , with earth and sea 's rich gems ,
307,With April 's first-born flowers , and all things rare ,
308,That heaven 's air in this huge rondure hems .
309,O ! let me , true in love , but truly write ,
310,And then believe me , my love is as fair
311,As any mother 's child , though not so bright
312,As those gold candles fix 'd in heaven 's air :
313,Let them say more that like of hearsay well ;
314,I will not praise that purpose not to sell .
315,XXII
316,My glass shall not persuade me I am old ,
317,So long as youth and thou are of one date ;
318,But when in thee time 's furrows I behold ,
319,Then look I death my days should expiate .
320,For all that beauty that doth cover thee ,
321,Is but the seemly raiment of my heart ,
322,Which in thy breast doth live , as thine in me :
323,How can I then be elder than thou art ?
324,O ! therefore love , be of thyself so wary
325,As I , not for myself , but for thee will ;
326,Bearing thy heart , which I will keep so chary
327,As tender nurse her babe from faring ill .
328,Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain ,
329,Thou gav ` st me thine not to give back again .
330,XXIII
331,As an unperfect actor on the stage ,
332,Who with his fear is put beside his part ,
333,Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage ,
334,Whose strength 's abundance weakens his own heart ;
335,So I , for fear of trust , forget to say
336,The perfect ceremony of love 's rite ,
337,And in mine own love 's strength seem to decay ,
338,O'ercharg 'd with burthen of mine own love 's might .
339,O ! let my looks be then the eloquence
340,And dumb presagers of my speaking breast ,
341,Who plead for love , and look for recompense ,
342,More than that tongue that more hath more express 'd .
343,O ! learn to read what silent love hath writ :
344,To hear with eyes belongs to love 's fine wit .
345,XXIV
346,Mine eye hath play 'd the painter and hath stell 'd ,
347,Thy beauty 's form in table of my heart ;
348,My body is the frame wherein ` tis held ,
349,And perspective it is best painter 's art .
350,For through the painter must you see his skill ,
351,To find where your true image pictur 'd lies ,
352,Which in my bosom 's shop is hanging still ,
353,That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes .
354,Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done :
355,Mine eyes have drawn thy shape , and thine for me
356,Are windows to my breast , where-through the sun
357,Delights to peep , to gaze therein on thee ;
358,Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art ,
359,They draw but what they see , know not the heart .
360,XXV
361,Let those who are in favour with their stars
362,Of public honour and proud titles boast ,
363,Whilst I , whom fortune of such triumph bars
364,Unlook 'd for joy in that I honour most .
365,Great princes ' favourites their fair leaves spread
366,But as the marigold at the sun 's eye ,
367,And in themselves their pride lies buried ,
368,For at a frown they in their glory die .
369,The painful warrior famoused for fight ,
370,After a thousand victories once foil 'd ,
371,Is from the book of honour razed quite ,
372,And all the rest forgot for which he toil 'd :
373,Then happy I , that love and am belov 'd ,
374,Where I may not remove nor be remov 'd .
375,XXVI
376,Lord of my love , to whom in vassalage
377,Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit ,
378,To thee I send this written embassage ,
379,To witness duty , not to show my wit :
380,Duty so great , which wit so poor as mine
381,May make seem bare , in wanting words to show it ,
382,But that I hope some good conceit of thine
383,In thy soul 's thought , all naked , will bestow it :
384,Till whatsoever star that guides my moving ,
385,Points on me graciously with fair aspect ,
386,And puts apparel on my tatter 'd loving ,
387,To show me worthy of thy sweet respect :
388,Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee ;
389,Till then , not show my head where thou mayst prove me .
390,XXVII
391,Weary with toil , I haste me to my bed ,
392,The dear respose for limbs with travel tir 'd ;
393,But then begins a journey in my head
394,To work my mind , when body 's work 's expired :
395,For then my thoughts -- from far where I abide --
396,Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee ,
397,And keep my drooping eyelids open wide ,
398,Looking on darkness which the blind do see :
399,Save that my soul 's imaginary sight
400,Presents thy shadow to my sightless view ,
401,Which , like a jewel hung in ghastly night ,
402,Makes black night beauteous , and her old face new .
403,Lo ! thus , by day my limbs , by night my mind ,
404,For thee , and for myself , no quiet find .
405,XXVIII
406,How can I then return in happy plight ,
407,That am debarre 'd the benefit of rest ?
408,When day 's oppression is not eas 'd by night ,
409,But day by night and night by day oppress 'd ,
410,And each , though enemies to either 's reign ,
411,Do in consent shake hands to torture me ,
412,The one by toil , the other to complain
413,How far I toil , still farther off from thee .
414,I tell the day , to please him thou art bright ,
415,And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven :
416,So flatter I the swart-complexion 'd night ,
417,When sparkling stars twire not thou gild ` st the even .
418,But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer ,
419,And night doth nightly make grief 's length seem stronger .
420,XXIX
421,When in disgrace with fortune and men 's eyes
422,I all alone beweep my outcast state ,
423,And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries ,
424,And look upon myself , and curse my fate ,
425,Wishing me like to one more rich in hope ,
426,Featur 'd like him , like him with friends possess 'd ,
427,Desiring this man 's art , and that man 's scope ,
428,With what I most enjoy contented least ;
429,Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising ,
430,Haply I think on thee , -- and then my state ,
431,Like to the lark at break of day arising
432,From sullen earth , sings hymns at heaven 's gate ;
433,For thy sweet love remember 'd such wealth brings
434,That then I scorn to change my state with kings .
435,XXX
436,When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
437,I summon up remembrance of things past ,
438,I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought ,
439,And with old woes new wail my dear time 's waste :
440,Then can I drown an eye , unused to flow ,
441,For precious friends hid in death 's dateless night ,
442,And weep afresh love 's long since cancell 'd woe ,
443,And moan the expense of many a vanish 'd sight :
444,Then can I grieve at grievances foregone ,
445,And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
446,The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan ,
447,Which I new pay as if not paid before .
448,But if the while I think on thee , dear friend ,
449,All losses are restor 'd and sorrows end .
450,XXXI
451,Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts ,
452,Which I by lacking have supposed dead ;
453,And there reigns Love , and all Love 's loving parts ,
454,And all those friends which I thought buried .
455,How many a holy and obsequious tear
456,Hath dear religious love stol 'n from mine eye ,
457,As interest of the dead , which now appear
458,But things remov 'd that hidden in thee lie !
459,Thou art the grave where buried love doth live ,
460,Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone ,
461,Who all their parts of me to thee did give ,
462,That due of many now is thine alone :
463,Their images I lov 'd , I view in thee ,
464,And thou -- all they -- hast all the all of me .
465,XXXII
466,If thou survive my well-contented day ,
467,When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
468,And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
469,These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover ,
470,Compare them with the bett ` ring of the time ,
471,And though they be outstripp 'd by every pen ,
472,Reserve them for my love , not for their rhyme ,
473,Exceeded by the height of happier men .
474,O ! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought :
475,` Had my friend 's Muse grown with this growing age ,
476,A dearer birth than this his love had brought ,
477,To march in ranks of better equipage :
478,But since he died and poets better prove ,
479,Theirs for their style I 'll read , his for his love ' .
480,XXXIII
481,Full many a glorious morning have I seen
482,Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye ,
483,Kissing with golden face the meadows green ,
484,Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy ;
485,Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
486,With ugly rack on his celestial face ,
487,And from the forlorn world his visage hide ,
488,Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace :
489,Even so my sun one early morn did shine ,
490,With all triumphant splendour on my brow ;
491,But out ! alack ! he was but one hour mine ,
492,The region cloud hath mask 'd him from me now .
493,Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth ;
494,Suns of the world may stain when heaven 's sun staineth .
495,XXXIV
496,Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day ,
497,And make me travel forth without my cloak ,
498,To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way ,
499,Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke ?
500,` Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break ,
501,To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face ,
502,For no man well of such a salve can speak ,
503,That heals the wound , and cures not the disgrace :
504,Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief ;
505,Though thou repent , yet I have still the loss :
506,The offender 's sorrow lends but weak relief
507,To him that bears the strong offence 's cross .
508,Ah ! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds ,
509,And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds .
510,XXXV
511,No more be griev 'd at that which thou hast done :
512,Roses have thorns , and silver fountains mud :
513,Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun ,
514,And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud .
515,All men make faults , and even I in this ,
516,Authorizing thy trespass with compare ,
517,Myself corrupting , salving thy amiss ,
518,Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are ;
519,For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense , --
520,Thy adverse party is thy advocate , --
521,And ` gainst myself a lawful plea commence :
522,Such civil war is in my love and hate ,
523,That I an accessary needs must be ,
524,To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me .
525,XXXVI
526,Let me confess that we two must be twain ,
527,Although our undivided loves are one :
528,So shall those blots that do with me remain ,
529,Without thy help , by me be borne alone .
530,In our two loves there is but one respect ,
531,Though in our lives a separable spite ,
532,Which though it alter not love 's sole effect ,
533,Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love 's delight .
534,I may not evermore acknowledge thee ,
535,Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame ,
536,Nor thou with public kindness honour me ,
537,Unless thou take that honour from thy name :
538,But do not so , I love thee in such sort ,
539,As thou being mine , mine is thy good report .
540,XXXVII
541,As a decrepit father takes delight
542,To see his active child do deeds of youth ,
543,So I , made lame by Fortune 's dearest spite ,
544,Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth ;
545,For whether beauty , birth , or wealth , or wit ,
546,Or any of these all , or all , or more ,
547,Entitled in thy parts , do crowned sit ,
548,I make my love engrafted , to this store :
549,So then I am not lame , poor , nor despis 'd ,
550,Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
551,That I in thy abundance am suffic 'd ,
552,And by a part of all thy glory live .
553,Look what is best , that best I wish in thee :
554,This wish I have ; then ten times happy me !
555,XXXVIII
556,How can my muse want subject to invent ,
557,While thou dost breathe , that pour ` st into my verse
558,Thine own sweet argument , too excellent
559,For every vulgar paper to rehearse ?
560,O ! give thy self the thanks , if aught in me
561,Worthy perusal stand against thy sight ;
562,For who 's so dumb that can not write to thee ,
563,When thou thy self dost give invention light ?
564,Be thou the tenth Muse , ten times more in worth
565,Than those old nine which rhymers invocate ;
566,And he that calls on thee , let him bring forth
567,Eternal numbers to outlive long date .
568,If my slight muse do please these curious days ,
569,The pain be mine , but thine shall be the praise .
570,XXXIX
571,O ! how thy worth with manners may I sing ,
572,When thou art all the better part of me ?
573,What can mine own praise to mine own self bring ?
574,And what is ' t but mine own when I praise thee ?
575,Even for this , let us divided live ,
576,And our dear love lose name of single one ,
577,That by this separation I may give
578,That due to thee which thou deserv ` st alone .
579,O absence ! what a torment wouldst thou prove ,
580,Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave ,
581,To entertain the time with thoughts of love ,
582,Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive ,
583,And that thou teachest how to make one twain ,
584,By praising him here who doth hence remain .
585,XL
586,Take all my loves , my love , yea take them all ;
587,What hast thou then more than thou hadst before ?
588,No love , my love , that thou mayst true love call ;
589,All mine was thine , before thou hadst this more .
590,Then , if for my love , thou my love receivest ,
591,I can not blame thee , for my love thou usest ;
592,But yet be blam 'd , if thou thy self deceivest
593,By wilful taste of what thyself refusest .
594,I do forgive thy robbery , gentle thief ,
595,Although thou steal thee all my poverty :
596,And yet , love knows it is a greater grief
597,To bear love 's wrong , than hate 's known injury .
598,Lascivious grace , in whom all ill well shows ,
599,Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes .
600,XLI
601,Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits ,
602,When I am sometime absent from thy heart ,
603,Thy beauty , and thy years full well befits ,
604,For still temptation follows where thou art .
605,Gentle thou art , and therefore to be won ,
606,Beauteous thou art , therefore to be assail 'd ;
607,And when a woman woos , what woman 's son
608,Will sourly leave her till he have prevail 'd ?
609,Ay me ! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear ,
610,And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth ,
611,Who lead thee in their riot even there
612,Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth : --
613,Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee ,
614,Thine by thy beauty being false to me .
615,XLII
616,That thou hast her it is not all my grief ,
617,And yet it may be said I loved her dearly ;
618,That she hath thee is of my wailing chief ,
619,A loss in love that touches me more nearly .
620,Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye :
621,Thou dost love her , because thou know ` st I love her ;
622,And for my sake even so doth she abuse me ,
623,Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her .
624,If I lose thee , my loss is my love 's gain ,
625,And losing her , my friend hath found that loss ;
626,Both find each other , and I lose both twain ,
627,And both for my sake lay on me this cross :
628,But here 's the joy ; my friend and I are one ;
629,Sweet flattery ! then she loves but me alone .
630,XLIII
631,When most I wink , then do mine eyes best see ,
632,For all the day they view things unrespected ;
633,But when I sleep , in dreams they look on thee ,
634,And darkly bright , are bright in dark directed .
635,Then thou , whose shadow shadows doth make bright ,
636,How would thy shadow 's form form happy show
637,To the clear day with thy much clearer light ,
638,When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so !
639,How would , I say , mine eyes be blessed made
640,By looking on thee in the living day ,
641,When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
642,Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay !
643,All days are nights to see till I see thee ,
644,And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me .
645,XLIV
646,If the dull substance of my flesh were thought ,
647,Injurious distance should not stop my way ;
648,For then despite of space I would be brought ,
649,From limits far remote , where thou dost stay .
650,No matter then although my foot did stand
651,Upon the farthest earth remov 'd from thee ;
652,For nimble thought can jump both sea and land ,
653,As soon as think the place where he would be .
654,But , ah ! thought kills me that I am not thought ,
655,To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone ,
656,But that so much of earth and water wrought ,
657,I must attend time 's leisure with my moan ;
658,Receiving nought by elements so slow
659,But heavy tears , badges of either 's woe .
660,XLV
661,The other two , slight air , and purging fire
662,Are both with thee , wherever I abide ;
663,The first my thought , the other my desire ,
664,These present-absent with swift motion slide .
665,For when these quicker elements are gone
666,In tender embassy of love to thee ,
667,My life , being made of four , with two alone
668,Sinks down to death , oppress 'd with melancholy ;
669,Until life 's composition be recur 'd
670,By those swift messengers return 'd from thee ,
671,Who even but now come back again , assur 'd ,
672,Of thy fair health , recounting it to me :
673,This told , I joy ; but then no longer glad ,
674,I send them back again , and straight grow sad .
675,XLVI
676,Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war ,
677,How to divide the conquest of thy sight ;
678,Mine eye my heart thy picture 's sight would bar ,
679,My heart mine eye the freedom of that right .
680,My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie , --
681,A closet never pierc 'd with crystal eyes --
682,But the defendant doth that plea deny ,
683,And says in him thy fair appearance lies .
684,To side this title is impannelled
685,A quest of thoughts , all tenants to the heart ;
686,And by their verdict is determined
687,The clear eye 's moiety , and the dear heart 's part :
688,As thus ; mine eye 's due is thy outward part ,
689,And my heart 's right , thy inward love of heart .
690,XLVII
691,Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took ,
692,And each doth good turns now unto the other :
693,When that mine eye is famish 'd for a look ,
694,Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother ,
695,With my love 's picture then my eye doth feast ,
696,And to the painted banquet bids my heart ;
697,Another time mine eye is my heart 's guest ,
698,And in his thoughts of love doth share a part :
699,So , either by thy picture or my love ,
700,Thy self away , art present still with me ;
701,For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move ,
702,And I am still with them , and they with thee ;
703,Or , if they sleep , thy picture in my sight
704,Awakes my heart , to heart 's and eye 's delight .
705,XLVIII
706,How careful was I when I took my way ,
707,Each trifle under truest bars to thrust ,
708,That to my use it might unused stay
709,From hands of falsehood , in sure wards of trust !
710,But thou , to whom my jewels trifles are ,
711,Most worthy comfort , now my greatest grief ,
712,Thou best of dearest , and mine only care ,
713,Art left the prey of every vulgar thief .
714,Thee have I not lock 'd up in any chest ,
715,Save where thou art not , though I feel thou art ,
716,Within the gentle closure of my breast ,
717,From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part ;
718,And even thence thou wilt be stol 'n I fear ,
719,For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear .
720,XLIX
721,Against that time , if ever that time come ,
722,When I shall see thee frown on my defects ,
723,When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum ,
724,Call 'd to that audit by advis 'd respects ;
725,Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass ,
726,And scarcely greet me with that sun , thine eye ,
727,When love , converted from the thing it was ,
728,Shall reasons find of settled gravity ;
729,Against that time do I ensconce me here ,
730,Within the knowledge of mine own desert ,
731,And this my hand , against my self uprear ,
732,To guard the lawful reasons on thy part :
733,To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws ,
734,Since why to love I can allege no cause .
735,L
736,How heavy do I journey on the way ,
737,When what I seek , my weary travel 's end ,
738,Doth teach that ease and that repose to say ,
739,` Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend ! '
740,The beast that bears me , tired with my woe ,
741,Plods dully on , to bear that weight in me ,
742,As if by some instinct the wretch did know
743,His rider lov 'd not speed , being made from thee :
744,The bloody spur can not provoke him on ,
745,That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide ,
746,Which heavily he answers with a groan ,
747,More sharp to me than spurring to his side ;
748,For that same groan doth put this in my mind ,
749,My grief lies onward , and my joy behind .
750,LI
751,Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
752,Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed :
753,From where thou art why should I haste me thence ?
754,Till I return , of posting is no need .
755,O ! what excuse will my poor beast then find ,
756,When swift extremity can seem but slow ?
757,Then should I spur , though mounted on the wind ,
758,In winged speed no motion shall I know ,
759,Then can no horse with my desire keep pace ;
760,Therefore desire , of perfect ` st love being made ,
761,Shall neigh -- no dull flesh -- in his fiery race ;
762,But love , for love , thus shall excuse my jade , --
763,` Since from thee going , he went wilful-slow ,
764,Towards thee I 'll run , and give him leave to go . '
765,LII
766,So am I as the rich , whose blessed key ,
767,Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure ,
768,The which he will not every hour survey ,
769,For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure .
770,Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare ,
771,Since , seldom coming in that long year set ,
772,Like stones of worth they thinly placed are ,
773,Or captain jewels in the carcanet .
774,So is the time that keeps you as my chest ,
775,Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide ,
776,To make some special instant special-blest ,
777,By new unfolding his imprison 'd pride .
778,Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope ,
779,Being had , to triumph ; being lacked , to hope .
780,LIII
781,What is your substance , whereof are you made ,
782,That millions of strange shadows on you tend ?
783,Since every one , hath every one , one shade ,
784,And you but one , can every shadow lend .
785,Describe Adonis , and the counterfeit
786,Is poorly imitated after you ;
787,On Helen 's cheek all art of beauty set ,
788,And you in Grecian tires are painted new :
789,Speak of the spring , and foison of the year ,
790,The one doth shadow of your beauty show ,
791,The other as your bounty doth appear ;
792,And you in every blessed shape we know .
793,In all external grace you have some part ,
794,But you like none , none you , for constant heart .
795,LIV
796,O ! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
797,By that sweet ornament which truth doth give .
798,The rose looks fair , but fairer we it deem
799,For that sweet odour , which doth in it live .
800,The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
801,As the perfumed tincture of the roses .
802,Hang on such thorns , and play as wantonly
803,When summer 's breath their masked buds discloses :
804,But , for their virtue only is their show ,
805,They live unwoo 'd , and unrespected fade ;
806,Die to themselves . Sweet roses do not so ;
807,Of their sweet deaths , are sweetest odours made :
808,And so of you , beauteous and lovely youth ,
809,When that shall vade , by verse distills your truth .
810,LV
811,Not marble , nor the gilded monuments
812,Of princes , shall outlive this powerful rhyme ;
813,But you shall shine more bright in these contents
814,Than unswept stone , besmear 'd with sluttish time .
815,When wasteful war shall statues overturn ,
816,And broils root out the work of masonry ,
817,Nor Mars his sword , nor war 's quick fire shall burn
818,The living record of your memory .
819,` Gainst death , and all-oblivious enmity
820,Shall you pace forth ; your praise shall still find room
821,Even in the eyes of all posterity
822,That wear this world out to the ending doom .
823,So , till the judgment that yourself arise ,
824,You live in this , and dwell in lovers ' eyes .
825,LVI
826,Sweet love , renew thy force ; be it not said
827,Thy edge should blunter be than appetite ,
828,Which but to-day by feeding is allay 'd ,
829,To-morrow sharpened in his former might :
830,So , love , be thou , although to-day thou fill
831,Thy hungry eyes , even till they wink with fulness ,
832,To-morrow see again , and do not kill
833,The spirit of love , with a perpetual dulness .
834,Let this sad interim like the ocean be
835,Which parts the shore , where two contracted new
836,Come daily to the banks , that when they see
837,Return of love , more blest may be the view ;
838,Or call it winter , which being full of care ,
839,Makes summer 's welcome , thrice more wished , more rare .
840,LVII
841,Being your slave what should I do but tend ,
842,Upon the hours , and times of your desire ?
843,I have no precious time at all to spend ;
844,Nor services to do , till you require .
845,Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour ,
846,Whilst I , my sovereign , watch the clock for you ,
847,Nor think the bitterness of absence sour ,
848,When you have bid your servant once adieu ;
849,Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
850,Where you may be , or your affairs suppose ,
851,But , like a sad slave , stay and think of nought
852,Save , where you are , how happy you make those .
853,So true a fool is love , that in your will ,
854,Though you do anything , he thinks no ill .
855,LVIII
856,That god forbid , that made me first your slave ,
857,I should in thought control your times of pleasure ,
858,Or at your hand the account of hours to crave ,
859,Being your vassal , bound to stay your leisure !
860,O ! let me suffer , being at your beck ,
861,The imprison 'd absence of your liberty ;
862,And patience , tame to sufferance , bide each check ,
863,Without accusing you of injury .
864,Be where you list , your charter is so strong
865,That you yourself may privilage your time
866,To what you will ; to you it doth belong
867,Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime .
868,I am to wait , though waiting so be hell ,
869,Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well .
870,LIX
871,If there be nothing new , but that which is
872,Hath been before , how are our brains beguil 'd ,
873,Which labouring for invention bear amiss
874,The second burthen of a former child !
875,O ! that record could with a backward look ,
876,Even of five hundred courses of the sun ,
877,Show me your image in some antique book ,
878,Since mind at first in character was done !
879,That I might see what the old world could say
880,To this composed wonder of your frame ;
881,Wh ' r we are mended , or wh ' r better they ,
882,Or whether revolution be the same .
883,O ! sure I am the wits of former days ,
884,To subjects worse have given admiring praise .
885,LX
886,Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore ,
887,So do our minutes hasten to their end ;
888,Each changing place with that which goes before ,
889,In sequent toil all forwards do contend .
890,Nativity , once in the main of light ,
891,Crawls to maturity , wherewith being crown 'd ,
892,Crooked eclipses ` gainst his glory fight ,
893,And Time that gave doth now his gift confound .
894,Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
895,And delves the parallels in beauty 's brow ,
896,Feeds on the rarities of nature 's truth ,
897,And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow :
898,And yet to times in hope , my verse shall stand .
899,Praising thy worth , despite his cruel hand .
900,LXI
901,Is it thy will , thy image should keep open
902,My heavy eyelids to the weary night ?
903,Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken ,
904,While shadows like to thee do mock my sight ?
905,Is it thy spirit that thou send ` st from thee
906,So far from home into my deeds to pry ,
907,To find out shames and idle hours in me ,
908,The scope and tenure of thy jealousy ?
909,O , no ! thy love , though much , is not so great :
910,It is my love that keeps mine eye awake :
911,Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat ,
912,To play the watchman ever for thy sake :
913,For thee watch I , whilst thou dost wake elsewhere ,
914,From me far off , with others all too near .
915,LXII
916,Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
917,And all my soul , and all my every part ;
918,And for this sin there is no remedy ,
919,It is so grounded inward in my heart .
920,Methinks no face so gracious is as mine ,
921,No shape so true , no truth of such account ;
922,And for myself mine own worth do define ,
923,As I all other in all worths surmount .
924,But when my glass shows me myself indeed
925,Beated and chopp 'd with tanned antiquity ,
926,Mine own self-love quite contrary I read ;
927,Self so self-loving were iniquity .
928,` Tis thee , -- myself , -- that for myself I praise ,
929,Painting my age with beauty of thy days .
930,LXIII
931,Against my love shall be as I am now ,
932,With Time 's injurious hand crush 'd and o'erworn ;
933,When hours have drain 'd his blood and fill 'd his brow
934,With lines and wrinkles ; when his youthful morn
935,Hath travell 'd on to age 's steepy night ;
936,And all those beauties whereof now he 's king
937,Are vanishing , or vanished out of sight ,
938,Stealing away the treasure of his spring ;
939,For such a time do I now fortify
940,Against confounding age 's cruel knife ,
941,That he shall never cut from memory
942,My sweet love 's beauty , though my lover 's life :
943,His beauty shall in these black lines be seen ,
944,And they shall live , and he in them still green .
945,LXIV
946,When I have seen by Time 's fell hand defac 'd
947,The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age ;
948,When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz 'd ,
949,And brass eternal slave to mortal rage ;
950,When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
951,Advantage on the kingdom of the shore ,
952,And the firm soil win of the watery main ,
953,Increasing store with loss , and loss with store ;
954,When I have seen such interchange of state ,
955,Or state itself confounded , to decay ;
956,Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate --
957,That Time will come and take my love away .
958,This thought is as a death which can not choose
959,But weep to have , that which it fears to lose .
960,LXV
961,Since brass , nor stone , nor earth , nor boundless sea ,
962,But sad mortality o'ersways their power ,
963,How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea ,
964,Whose action is no stronger than a flower ?
965,O ! how shall summer 's honey breath hold out ,
966,Against the wrackful siege of battering days ,
967,When rocks impregnable are not so stout ,
968,Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays ?
969,O fearful meditation ! where , alack ,
970,Shall Time 's best jewel from Time 's chest lie hid ?
971,Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back ?
972,Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid ?
973,O ! none , unless this miracle have might ,
974,That in black ink my love may still shine bright .
975,LXVI
976,Tired with all these , for restful death I cry ,
977,As to behold desert a beggar born ,
978,And needy nothing trimm 'd in jollity ,
979,And purest faith unhappily forsworn ,
980,And gilded honour shamefully misplac 'd ,
981,And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted ,
982,And right perfection wrongfully disgrac 'd ,
983,And strength by limping sway disabled
984,And art made tongue-tied by authority ,
985,And folly -- doctor-like -- controlling skill ,
986,And simple truth miscall 'd simplicity ,
987,And captive good attending captain ill :
988,Tir 'd with all these , from these would I be gone ,
989,Save that , to die , I leave my love alone .
990,LXVII
991,Ah ! wherefore with infection should he live ,
992,And with his presence grace impiety ,
993,That sin by him advantage should achieve ,
994,And lace itself with his society ?
995,Why should false painting imitate his cheek ,
996,And steel dead seeming of his living hue ?
997,Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
998,Roses of shadow , since his rose is true ?
999,Why should he live , now Nature bankrupt is ,
1000,Beggar 'd of blood to blush through lively veins ?
1001,For she hath no exchequer now but his ,
1002,And proud of many , lives upon his gains .
1003,O ! him she stores , to show what wealth she had
1004,In days long since , before these last so bad .
1005,LXVIII
1006,Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn ,
1007,When beauty lived and died as flowers do now ,
1008,Before these bastard signs of fair were born ,
1009,Or durst inhabit on a living brow ;
1010,Before the golden tresses of the dead ,
1011,The right of sepulchres , were shorn away ,
1012,To live a second life on second head ;
1013,Ere beauty 's dead fleece made another gay :
1014,In him those holy antique hours are seen ,
1015,Without all ornament , itself and true ,
1016,Making no summer of another 's green ,
1017,Robbing no old to dress his beauty new ;
1018,And him as for a map doth Nature store ,
1019,To show false Art what beauty was of yore .
1020,LXIX
1021,Those parts of thee that the world 's eye doth view
1022,Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend ;
1023,All tongues -- the voice of souls -- give thee that due ,
1024,Uttering bare truth , even so as foes commend .
1025,Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown 'd ;
1026,But those same tongues , that give thee so thine own ,
1027,In other accents do this praise confound
1028,By seeing farther than the eye hath shown .
1029,They look into the beauty of thy mind ,
1030,And that in guess they measure by thy deeds ;
1031,Then -- churls -- their thoughts , although their eyes were kind ,
1032,To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds :
1033,But why thy odour matcheth not thy show ,
1034,The soil is this , that thou dost common grow .
1035,LXX
1036,That thou art blam 'd shall not be thy defect ,
1037,For slander 's mark was ever yet the fair ;
1038,The ornament of beauty is suspect ,
1039,A crow that flies in heaven 's sweetest air .
1040,So thou be good , slander doth but approve
1041,Thy worth the greater being woo 'd of time ;
1042,For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love ,
1043,And thou present ` st a pure unstained prime .
1044,Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
1045,Either not assail 'd , or victor being charg 'd ;
1046,Yet this thy praise can not be so thy praise ,
1047,To tie up envy , evermore enlarg 'd ,
1048,If some suspect of ill mask 'd not thy show ,
1049,Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe .
1050,LXXI
1051,No longer mourn for me when I am dead
1052,Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
1053,Give warning to the world that I am fled
1054,From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell :
1055,Nay , if you read this line , remember not
1056,The hand that writ it , for I love you so ,
1057,That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot ,
1058,If thinking on me then should make you woe .
1059,O ! if , -- I say you look upon this verse ,
1060,When I perhaps compounded am with clay ,
1061,Do not so much as my poor name rehearse ;
1062,But let your love even with my life decay ;
1063,Lest the wise world should look into your moan ,
1064,And mock you with me after I am gone .
1065,LXXII
1066,O ! lest the world should task you to recite
1067,What merit lived in me , that you should love
1068,After my death , -- dear love , forget me quite ,
1069,For you in me can nothing worthy prove ;
1070,Unless you would devise some virtuous lie ,
1071,To do more for me than mine own desert ,
1072,And hang more praise upon deceased I
1073,Than niggard truth would willingly impart :
1074,O ! lest your true love may seem false in this
1075,That you for love speak well of me untrue ,
1076,My name be buried where my body is ,
1077,And live no more to shame nor me nor you .
1078,For I am shamed by that which I bring forth ,
1079,And so should you , to love things nothing worth .
1080,LXXIII
1081,That time of year thou mayst in me behold
1082,When yellow leaves , or none , or few , do hang
1083,Upon those boughs which shake against the cold ,
1084,Bare ruin 'd choirs , where late the sweet birds sang .
1085,In me thou see ` st the twilight of such day
1086,As after sunset fadeth in the west ;
1087,Which by and by black night doth take away ,
1088,Death 's second self , that seals up all in rest .
1089,In me thou see ` st the glowing of such fire ,
1090,That on the ashes of his youth doth lie ,
1091,As the death-bed , whereon it must expire ,
1092,Consum 'd with that which it was nourish 'd by .
1093,This thou perceiv ` st , which makes thy love more strong ,
1094,To love that well , which thou must leave ere long .
1095,LXXIV
1096,But be contented : when that fell arrest
1097,Without all bail shall carry me away ,
1098,My life hath in this line some interest ,
1099,Which for memorial still with thee shall stay .
1100,When thou reviewest this , thou dost review
1101,The very part was consecrate to thee :
1102,The earth can have but earth , which is his due ;
1103,My spirit is thine , the better part of me :
1104,So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life ,
1105,The prey of worms , my body being dead ;
1106,The coward conquest of a wretch 's knife ,
1107,Too base of thee to be remembered .
1108,The worth of that is that which it contains ,
1109,And that is this , and this with thee remains .
1110,LXXV
1111,So are you to my thoughts as food to life ,
1112,Or as sweet-season 'd showers are to the ground ;
1113,And for the peace of you I hold such strife
1114,As ` twixt a miser and his wealth is found .
1115,Now proud as an enjoyer , and anon
1116,Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure ;
1117,Now counting best to be with you alone ,
1118,Then better 'd that the world may see my pleasure :
1119,Sometime all full with feasting on your sight ,
1120,And by and by clean starved for a look ;
1121,Possessing or pursuing no delight ,
1122,Save what is had , or must from you be took .
1123,Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day ,
1124,Or gluttoning on all , or all away .
1125,LXXVI
1126,Why is my verse so barren of new pride ,
1127,So far from variation or quick change ?
1128,Why with the time do I not glance aside
1129,To new-found methods , and to compounds strange ?
1130,Why write I still all one , ever the same ,
1131,And keep invention in a noted weed ,
1132,That every word doth almost tell my name ,
1133,Showing their birth , and where they did proceed ?
1134,O ! know sweet love I always write of you ,
1135,And you and love are still my argument ;
1136,So all my best is dressing old words new ,
1137,Spending again what is already spent :
1138,For as the sun is daily new and old ,
1139,So is my love still telling what is told .
1140,LXXVII
1141,Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear ,
1142,Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste ;
1143,These vacant leaves thy mind 's imprint will bear ,
1144,And of this book , this learning mayst thou taste .
1145,The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
1146,Of mouthed graves will give thee memory ;
1147,Thou by thy dial 's shady stealth mayst know
1148,Time 's thievish progress to eternity .
1149,Look ! what thy memory can not contain ,
1150,Commit to these waste blanks , and thou shalt find
1151,Those children nursed , deliver 'd from thy brain ,
1152,To take a new acquaintance of thy mind .
1153,These offices , so oft as thou wilt look ,
1154,Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book .
1155,LXXVIII
1156,So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse ,
1157,And found such fair assistance in my verse
1158,As every alien pen hath got my use
1159,And under thee their poesy disperse .
1160,Thine eyes , that taught the dumb on high to sing
1161,And heavy ignorance aloft to fly ,
1162,Have added feathers to the learned 's wing
1163,And given grace a double majesty .
1164,Yet be most proud of that which I compile ,
1165,Whose influence is thine , and born of thee :
1166,In others ' works thou dost but mend the style ,
1167,And arts with thy sweet graces graced be ;
1168,But thou art all my art , and dost advance
1169,As high as learning , my rude ignorance .
1170,LXXIX
1171,Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid ,
1172,My verse alone had all thy gentle grace ;
1173,But now my gracious numbers are decay 'd ,
1174,And my sick Muse doth give an other place .
1175,I grant , sweet love , thy lovely argument
1176,Deserves the travail of a worthier pen ;
1177,Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
1178,He robs thee of , and pays it thee again .
1179,He lends thee virtue , and he stole that word
1180,From thy behaviour ; beauty doth he give ,
1181,And found it in thy cheek : he can afford
1182,No praise to thee , but what in thee doth live .
1183,Then thank him not for that which he doth say ,
1184,Since what he owes thee , thou thyself dost pay .
1185,LXXX
1186,O ! how I faint when I of you do write ,
1187,Knowing a better spirit doth use your name ,
1188,And in the praise thereof spends all his might ,
1189,To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame !
1190,But since your worth -- wide as the ocean is , --
1191,The humble as the proudest sail doth bear ,
1192,My saucy bark , inferior far to his ,
1193,On your broad main doth wilfully appear .
1194,Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat ,
1195,Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride ;
1196,Or , being wrack 'd , I am a worthless boat ,
1197,He of tall building , and of goodly pride :
1198,Then if he thrive and I be cast away ,
1199,The worst was this , -- my love was my decay .
1200,LXXXI
1201,Or I shall live your epitaph to make ,
1202,Or you survive when I in earth am rotten ;
1203,From hence your memory death can not take ,
1204,Although in me each part will be forgotten .
1205,Your name from hence immortal life shall have ,
1206,Though I , once gone , to all the world must die :
1207,The earth can yield me but a common grave ,
1208,When you entombed in men 's eyes shall lie .
1209,Your monument shall be my gentle verse ,
1210,Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read ;
1211,And tongues to be , your being shall rehearse ,
1212,When all the breathers of this world are dead ;
1213,You still shall live , -- such virtue hath my pen , --
1214,Where breath most breathes , even in the mouths of men .
1215,LXXXII
1216,I grant thou wert not married to my Muse ,
1217,And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
1218,The dedicated words which writers use
1219,Of their fair subject , blessing every book .
1220,Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue ,
1221,Finding thy worth a limit past my praise ;
1222,And therefore art enforced to seek anew
1223,Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days .
1224,And do so , love ; yet when they have devis 'd ,
1225,What strained touches rhetoric can lend ,
1226,Thou truly fair , wert truly sympathiz 'd
1227,In true plain words , by thy true-telling friend ;
1228,And their gross painting might be better us 'd
1229,Where cheeks need blood ; in thee it is abus 'd .
1230,LXXXIII
1231,I never saw that you did painting need ,
1232,And therefore to your fair no painting set ;
1233,I found , or thought I found , you did exceed
1234,That barren tender of a poet 's debt :
1235,And therefore have I slept in your report ,
1236,That you yourself , being extant , well might show
1237,How far a modern quill doth come too short ,
1238,Speaking of worth , what worth in you doth grow .
1239,This silence for my sin you did impute ,
1240,Which shall be most my glory being dumb ;
1241,For I impair not beauty being mute ,
1242,When others would give life , and bring a tomb .
1243,There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
1244,Than both your poets can in praise devise .
1245,LXXXIV
1246,Who is it that says most , which can say more ,
1247,Than this rich praise , -- that you alone , are you ?
1248,In whose confine immured is the store
1249,Which should example where your equal grew .
1250,Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
1251,That to his subject lends not some small glory ;
1252,But he that writes of you , if he can tell
1253,That you are you , so dignifies his story ,
1254,Let him but copy what in you is writ ,
1255,Not making worse what nature made so clear ,
1256,And such a counterpart shall fame his wit ,
1257,Making his style admired every where .
1258,You to your beauteous blessings add a curse ,
1259,Being fond on praise , which makes your praises worse .
1260,LXXXV
1261,My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still ,
1262,While comments of your praise richly compil 'd ,
1263,Reserve their character with golden quill ,
1264,And precious phrase by all the Muses fil 'd .
1265,I think good thoughts , whilst others write good words ,
1266,And like unlettered clerk still cry ` Amen '
1267,To every hymn that able spirit affords ,
1268,In polish 'd form of well-refined pen .
1269,Hearing you praised , I say '' tis so , ` tis true , '
1270,And to the most of praise add something more ;
1271,But that is in my thought , whose love to you ,
1272,Though words come hindmost , holds his rank before .
1273,Then others , for the breath of words respect ,
1274,Me for my dumb thoughts , speaking in effect .
1275,LXXXVI
1276,Was it the proud full sail of his great verse ,
1277,Bound for the prize of all too precious you ,
1278,That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse ,
1279,Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew ?
1280,Was it his spirit , by spirits taught to write ,
1281,Above a mortal pitch , that struck me dead ?
1282,No , neither he , nor his compeers by night
1283,Giving him aid , my verse astonished .
1284,He , nor that affable familiar ghost
1285,Which nightly gulls him with intelligence ,
1286,As victors of my silence can not boast ;
1287,I was not sick of any fear from thence :
1288,But when your countenance fill 'd up his line ,
1289,Then lacked I matter ; that enfeebled mine .
1290,LXXXVII
1291,Farewell ! thou art too dear for my possessing ,
1292,And like enough thou know ` st thy estimate ,
1293,The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing ;
1294,My bonds in thee are all determinate .
1295,For how do I hold thee but by thy granting ?
1296,And for that riches where is my deserving ?
1297,The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting ,
1298,And so my patent back again is swerving .
1299,Thy self thou gav ` st , thy own worth then not knowing ,
1300,Or me to whom thou gav ` st it , else mistaking ;
1301,So thy great gift , upon misprision growing ,
1302,Comes home again , on better judgement making .
1303,Thus have I had thee , as a dream doth flatter ,
1304,In sleep a king , but waking no such matter .
1305,LXXXVIII
1306,When thou shalt be dispos 'd to set me light ,
1307,And place my merit in the eye of scorn ,
1308,Upon thy side , against myself I 'll fight ,
1309,And prove thee virtuous , though thou art forsworn .
1310,With mine own weakness , being best acquainted ,
1311,Upon thy part I can set down a story
1312,Of faults conceal 'd , wherein I am attainted ;
1313,That thou in losing me shalt win much glory :
1314,And I by this will be a gainer too ;
1315,For bending all my loving thoughts on thee ,
1316,The injuries that to myself I do ,
1317,Doing thee vantage , double-vantage me .
1318,Such is my love , to thee I so belong ,
1319,That for thy right , myself will bear all wrong .
1320,LXXXIX
1321,Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault ,
1322,And I will comment upon that offence :
1323,Speak of my lameness , and I straight will halt ,
1324,Against thy reasons making no defence .
1325,Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill ,
1326,To set a form upon desired change ,
1327,As I 'll myself disgrace ; knowing thy will ,
1328,I will acquaintance strangle , and look strange ;
1329,Be absent from thy walks ; and in my tongue
1330,Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell ,
1331,Lest I , too much profane , should do it wrong ,
1332,And haply of our old acquaintance tell .
1333,For thee , against my self I 'll vow debate ,
1334,For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate .
1335,XC
1336,Then hate me when thou wilt ; if ever , now ;
1337,Now , while the world is bent my deeds to cross ,
1338,Join with the spite of fortune , make me bow ,
1339,And do not drop in for an after-loss :
1340,Ah ! do not , when my heart hath ` scap 'd this sorrow ,
1341,Come in the rearward of a conquer 'd woe ;
1342,Give not a windy night a rainy morrow ,
1343,To linger out a purpos 'd overthrow .
1344,If thou wilt leave me , do not leave me last ,
1345,When other petty griefs have done their spite ,
1346,But in the onset come : so shall I taste
1347,At first the very worst of fortune 's might ;
1348,And other strains of woe , which now seem woe ,
1349,Compar 'd with loss of thee , will not seem so .
1350,XCI
1351,Some glory in their birth , some in their skill ,
1352,Some in their wealth , some in their body 's force ,
1353,Some in their garments though new-fangled ill ;
1354,Some in their hawks and hounds , some in their horse ;
1355,And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure ,
1356,Wherein it finds a joy above the rest :
1357,But these particulars are not my measure ,
1358,All these I better in one general best .
1359,Thy love is better than high birth to me ,
1360,Richer than wealth , prouder than garments ' costs ,
1361,Of more delight than hawks and horses be ;
1362,And having thee , of all men 's pride I boast :
1363,Wretched in this alone , that thou mayst take
1364,All this away , and me most wretchcd make .
1365,XCII
1366,But do thy worst to steal thyself away ,
1367,For term of life thou art assured mine ;
1368,And life no longer than thy love will stay ,
1369,For it depends upon that love of thine .
1370,Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs ,
1371,When in the least of them my life hath end .
1372,I see a better state to me belongs
1373,Than that which on thy humour doth depend :
1374,Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind ,
1375,Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie .
1376,O ! what a happy title do I find ,
1377,Happy to have thy love , happy to die !
1378,But what 's so blessed-fair that fears no blot ?
1379,Thou mayst be false , and yet I know it not .
1380,XCIII
1381,So shall I live , supposing thou art true ,
1382,Like a deceived husband ; so love 's face
1383,May still seem love to me , though alter 'd new ;
1384,Thy looks with me , thy heart in other place :
1385,For there can live no hatred in thine eye ,
1386,Therefore in that I can not know thy change .
1387,In many 's looks , the false heart 's history
1388,Is writ in moods , and frowns , and wrinkles strange .
1389,But heaven in thy creation did decree
1390,That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell ;
1391,Whate'er thy thoughts , or thy heart 's workings be ,
1392,Thy looks should nothing thence , but sweetness tell .
1393,How like Eve 's apple doth thy beauty grow ,
1394,If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show !
1395,XCIV
1396,They that have power to hurt , and will do none ,
1397,That do not do the thing they most do show ,
1398,Who , moving others , are themselves as stone ,
1399,Unmoved , cold , and to temptation slow ;
1400,They rightly do inherit heaven 's graces ,
1401,And husband nature 's riches from expense ;
1402,They are the lords and owners of their faces ,
1403,Others , but stewards of their excellence .
1404,The summer 's flower is to the summer sweet ,
1405,Though to itself , it only live and die ,
1406,But if that flower with base infection meet ,
1407,The basest weed outbraves his dignity :
1408,For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds ;
1409,Lilies that fester , smell far worse than weeds .
1410,XCV
1411,How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
1412,Which , like a canker in the fragrant rose ,
1413,Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name !
1414,O ! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose .
1415,That tongue that tells the story of thy days ,
1416,Making lascivious comments on thy sport ,
1417,Can not dispraise , but in a kind of praise ;
1418,Naming thy name , blesses an ill report .
1419,O ! what a mansion have those vices got
1420,Which for their habitation chose out thee ,
1421,Where beauty 's veil doth cover every blot
1422,And all things turns to fair that eyes can see !
1423,Take heed , dear heart , of this large privilege ;
1424,The hardest knife ill-us 'd doth lose his edge .
1425,XCVI
1426,Some say thy fault is youth , some wantonness ;
1427,Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport ;
1428,Both grace and faults are lov 'd of more and less :
1429,Thou mak ` st faults graces that to thee resort .
1430,As on the finger of a throned queen
1431,The basest jewel will be well esteem 'd ,
1432,So are those errors that in thee are seen
1433,To truths translated , and for true things deem 'd .
1434,How many lambs might the stern wolf betray ,
1435,If like a lamb he could his looks translate !
1436,How many gazers mightst thou lead away ,
1437,if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state !
1438,But do not so ; I love thee in such sort ,
1439,As , thou being mine , mine is thy good report .
1440,XCVII
1441,How like a winter hath my absence been
1442,From thee , the pleasure of the fleeting year !
1443,What freezings have I felt , what dark days seen !
1444,What old December 's bareness everywhere !
1445,And yet this time removed was summer 's time ;
1446,The teeming autumn , big with rich increase ,
1447,Bearing the wanton burden of the prime ,
1448,Like widow 'd wombs after their lords ' decease :
1449,Yet this abundant issue seem 'd to me
1450,But hope of orphans , and unfather 'd fruit ;
1451,For summer and his pleasures wait on thee ,
1452,And , thou away , the very birds are mute :
1453,Or , if they sing , ` tis with so dull a cheer ,
1454,That leaves look pale , dreading the winter 's near .
1455,XCVIII
1456,From you have I been absent in the spring ,
1457,When proud-pied April , dress 'd in all his trim ,
1458,Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing ,
1459,That heavy Saturn laugh 'd and leap 'd with him .
1460,Yet nor the lays of birds , nor the sweet smell
1461,Of different flowers in odour and in hue ,
1462,Could make me any summer 's story tell ,
1463,Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew :
1464,Nor did I wonder at the lily 's white ,
1465,Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose ;
1466,They were but sweet , but figures of delight ,
1467,Drawn after you , you pattern of all those .
1468,Yet seem 'd it winter still , and you away ,
1469,As with your shadow I with these did play .
1470,XCIX
1471,The forward violet thus did I chide :
1472,Sweet thief , whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells ,
1473,If not from my love 's breath ? The purple pride
1474,Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
1475,In my love 's veins thou hast too grossly dy 'd .
1476,The lily I condemned for thy hand ,
1477,And buds of marjoram had stol 'n thy hair ;
1478,The roses fearfully on thorns did stand ,
1479,One blushing shame , another white despair ;
1480,A third , nor red nor white , had stol 'n of both ,
1481,And to his robbery had annex 'd thy breath ;
1482,But , for his theft , in pride of all his growth
1483,A vengeful canker eat him up to death .
1484,More flowers I noted , yet I none could see ,
1485,But sweet , or colour it had stol 'n from thee .
1486,C
1487,Where art thou Muse that thou forget ` st so long ,
1488,To speak of that which gives thee all thy might ?
1489,Spend ` st thou thy fury on some worthless song ,
1490,Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light ?
1491,Return forgetful Muse , and straight redeem ,
1492,In gentle numbers time so idly spent ;
1493,Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
1494,And gives thy pen both skill and argument .
1495,Rise , resty Muse , my love 's sweet face survey ,
1496,If Time have any wrinkle graven there ;
1497,If any , be a satire to decay ,
1498,And make time 's spoils despised every where .
1499,Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life ,
1500,So thou prevent ` st his scythe and crooked knife .
1501,CI
1502,O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
1503,For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy 'd ?
1504,Both truth and beauty on my love depends ;
1505,So dost thou too , and therein dignified .
1506,Make answer Muse : wilt thou not haply say ,
1507,` Truth needs no colour , with his colour fix 'd ;
1508,Beauty no pencil , beauty 's truth to lay ;
1509,But best is best , if never intermix 'd ' ?
1510,Because he needs no praise , wilt thou be dumb ?
1511,Excuse not silence so , for ' t lies in thee
1512,To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
1513,And to be prais 'd of ages yet to be .
1514,Then do thy office , Muse ; I teach thee how
1515,To make him seem long hence as he shows now .
1516,CII
1517,My love is strengthen 'd , though more weak in seeming ;
1518,I love not less , though less the show appear ;
1519,That love is merchandiz 'd , whose rich esteeming ,
1520,The owner 's tongue doth publish every where .
1521,Our love was new , and then but in the spring ,
1522,When I was wont to greet it with my lays ;
1523,As Philomel in summer 's front doth sing ,
1524,And stops her pipe in growth of riper days :
1525,Not that the summer is less pleasant now
1526,Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night ,
1527,But that wild music burthens every bough ,
1528,And sweets grown common lose their dear delight .
1529,Therefore like her , I sometime hold my tongue :
1530,Because I would not dull you with my song .
1531,CIII
1532,Alack ! what poverty my Muse brings forth ,
1533,That having such a scope to show her pride ,
1534,The argument , all bare , is of more worth
1535,Than when it hath my added praise beside !
1536,O ! blame me not , if I no more can write !
1537,Look in your glass , and there appears a face
1538,That over-goes my blunt invention quite ,
1539,Dulling my lines , and doing me disgrace .
1540,Were it not sinful then , striving to mend ,
1541,To mar the subject that before was well ?
1542,For to no other pass my verses tend
1543,Than of your graces and your gifts to tell ;
1544,And more , much more , than in my verse can sit ,
1545,Your own glass shows you when you look in it .
1546,CIV
1547,To me , fair friend , you never can be old ,
1548,For as you were when first your eye I ey 'd ,
1549,Such seems your beauty still . Three winters cold ,
1550,Have from the forests shook three summers ' pride ,
1551,Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn 'd ,
1552,In process of the seasons have I seen ,
1553,Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn 'd ,
1554,Since first I saw you fresh , which yet are green .
1555,Ah ! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand ,
1556,Steal from his figure , and no pace perceiv 'd ;
1557,So your sweet hue , which methinks still doth stand ,
1558,Hath motion , and mine eye may be deceiv 'd :
1559,For fear of which , hear this thou age unbred :
1560,Ere you were born was beauty 's summer dead .
1561,CV
1562,Let not my love be call 'd idolatry ,
1563,Nor my beloved as an idol show ,
1564,Since all alike my songs and praises be
1565,To one , of one , still such , and ever so .
1566,Kind is my love to-day , to-morrow kind ,
1567,Still constant in a wondrous excellence ;
1568,Therefore my verse to constancy confin 'd ,
1569,One thing expressing , leaves out difference .
1570,` Fair , kind , and true , ' is all my argument ,
1571,` Fair , kind , and true , ' varying to other words ;
1572,And in this change is my invention spent ,
1573,Three themes in one , which wondrous scope affords .
1574,Fair , kind , and true , have often liv 'd alone ,
1575,Which three till now , never kept seat in one .
1576,CVI
1577,When in the chronicle of wasted time
1578,I see descriptions of the fairest wights ,
1579,And beauty making beautiful old rime ,
1580,In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights ,
1581,Then , in the blazon of sweet beauty 's best ,
1582,Of hand , of foot , of lip , of eye , of brow ,
1583,I see their antique pen would have express 'd
1584,Even such a beauty as you master now .
1585,So all their praises are but prophecies
1586,Of this our time , all you prefiguring ;
1587,And for they looked but with divining eyes ,
1588,They had not skill enough your worth to sing :
1589,For we , which now behold these present days ,
1590,Have eyes to wonder , but lack tongues to praise .
1591,CVII
1592,Not mine own fears , nor the prophetic soul
1593,Of the wide world dreaming on things to come ,
1594,Can yet the lease of my true love control ,
1595,Supposed as forfeit to a confin 'd doom .
1596,The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur 'd ,
1597,And the sad augurs mock their own presage ;
1598,Incertainties now crown themselves assur 'd ,
1599,And peace proclaims olives of endless age .
1600,Now with the drops of this most balmy time ,
1601,My love looks fresh , and Death to me subscribes ,
1602,Since , spite of him , I 'll live in this poor rime ,
1603,While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes :
1604,And thou in this shalt find thy monument ,
1605,When tyrants ' crests and tombs of brass are spent .
1606,CVIII
1607,What 's in the brain , that ink may character ,
1608,Which hath not figur 'd to thee my true spirit ?
1609,What 's new to speak , what now to register ,
1610,That may express my love , or thy dear merit ?
1611,Nothing , sweet boy ; but yet , like prayers divine ,
1612,I must each day say o'er the very same ;
1613,Counting no old thing old , thou mine , I thine ,
1614,Even as when first I hallow 'd thy fair name .
1615,So that eternal love in love 's fresh case ,
1616,Weighs not the dust and injury of age ,
1617,Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place ,
1618,But makes antiquity for aye his page ;
1619,Finding the first conceit of love there bred ,
1620,Where time and outward form would show it dead .
1621,CIX
1622,O ! never say that I was false of heart ,
1623,Though absence seem 'd my flame to qualify ,
1624,As easy might I from my self depart
1625,As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie :
1626,That is my home of love : if I have rang 'd ,
1627,Like him that travels , I return again ;
1628,Just to the time , not with the time exchang 'd ,
1629,So that myself bring water for my stain .
1630,Never believe though in my nature reign 'd ,
1631,All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood ,
1632,That it could so preposterously be stain 'd ,
1633,To leave for nothing all thy sum of good ;
1634,For nothing this wide universe I call ,
1635,Save thou , my rose , in it thou art my all .
1636,CX
1637,Alas ! ` tis true , I have gone here and there ,
1638,And made my self a motley to the view ,
1639,Gor 'd mine own thoughts , sold cheap what is most dear ,
1640,Made old offences of affections new ;
1641,Most true it is , that I have look 'd on truth
1642,Askance and strangely ; but , by all above ,
1643,These blenches gave my heart another youth ,
1644,And worse essays prov 'd thee my best of love .
1645,Now all is done , save what shall have no end :
1646,Mine appetite I never more will grind
1647,On newer proof , to try an older friend ,
1648,A god in love , to whom I am confin 'd .
1649,Then give me welcome , next my heaven the best ,
1650,Even to thy pure and most most loving breast .
1651,CXI
1652,O ! for my sake do you with Fortune chide ,
1653,The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds ,
1654,That did not better for my life provide
1655,Than public means which public manners breeds .
1656,Thence comes it that my name receives a brand ,
1657,And almost thence my nature is subdu 'd
1658,To what it works in , like the dyer 's hand :
1659,Pity me , then , and wish I were renew 'd ;
1660,Whilst , like a willing patient , I will drink ,
1661,Potions of eisel ` gainst my strong infection ;
1662,No bitterness that I will bitter think ,
1663,Nor double penance , to correct correction .
1664,Pity me then , dear friend , and I assure ye ,
1665,Even that your pity is enough to cure me .
1666,CXII
1667,Your love and pity doth the impression fill ,
1668,Which vulgar scandal stamp 'd upon my brow ;
1669,For what care I who calls me well or ill ,
1670,So you o'er-green my bad , my good allow ?
1671,You are my all-the-world , and I must strive
1672,To know my shames and praises from your tongue ;
1673,None else to me , nor I to none alive ,
1674,That my steel 'd sense or changes right or wrong .
1675,In so profound abysm I throw all care
1676,Of others ' voices , that my adder 's sense
1677,To critic and to flatterer stopped are .
1678,Mark how with my neglect I do dispense :
1679,You are so strongly in my purpose bred ,
1680,That all the world besides methinks are dead .
1681,CXIII
1682,Since I left you , mine eye is in my mind ;
1683,And that which governs me to go about
1684,Doth part his function and is partly blind ,
1685,Seems seeing , but effectually is out ;
1686,For it no form delivers to the heart
1687,Of bird , of flower , or shape which it doth latch :
1688,Of his quick objects hath the mind no part ,
1689,Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch ;
1690,For if it see the rud ` st or gentlest sight ,
1691,The most sweet favour or deformed ` st creature ,
1692,The mountain or the sea , the day or night :
1693,The crow , or dove , it shapes them to your feature .
1694,Incapable of more , replete with you ,
1695,My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue .
1696,CXIV
1697,Or whether doth my mind , being crown 'd with you ,
1698,Drink up the monarch 's plague , this flattery ?
1699,Or whether shall I say , mine eye saith true ,
1700,And that your love taught it this alchemy ,
1701,To make of monsters and things indigest
1702,Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble ,
1703,Creating every bad a perfect best ,
1704,As fast as objects to his beams assemble ?
1705,O ! ` tis the first , ` tis flattery in my seeing ,
1706,And my great mind most kingly drinks it up :
1707,Mine eye well knows what with his gust is ` greeing ,
1708,And to his palate doth prepare the cup :
1709,If it be poison 'd , ` tis the lesser sin
1710,That mine eye loves it and doth first begin .
1711,CXV
1712,Those lines that I before have writ do lie ,
1713,Even those that said I could not love you dearer :
1714,Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
1715,My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer .
1716,But reckoning Time , whose million 'd accidents
1717,Creep in ` twixt vows , and change decrees of kings ,
1718,Tan sacred beauty , blunt the sharp ` st intents ,
1719,Divert strong minds to the course of altering things ;
1720,Alas ! why fearing of Time 's tyranny ,
1721,Might I not then say , ` Now I love you best , '
1722,When I was certain o'er incertainty ,
1723,Crowning the present , doubting of the rest ?
1724,Love is a babe , then might I not say so ,
1725,To give full growth to that which still doth grow ?
1726,CXVI
1727,Let me not to the marriage of true minds
1728,Admit impediments . Love is not love
1729,Which alters when it alteration finds ,
1730,Or bends with the remover to remove :
1731,O , no ! it is an ever-fixed mark ,
1732,That looks on tempests and is never shaken ;
1733,It is the star to every wandering bark ,
1734,Whose worth 's unknown , although his height be taken .
1735,Love 's not Time 's fool , though rosy lips and cheeks
1736,Within his bending sickle 's compass come ;
1737,Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks ,
1738,But bears it out even to the edge of doom .
1739,If this be error and upon me prov 'd ,
1740,I never writ , nor no man ever lov 'd .
1741,CXVII
1742,Accuse me thus : that I have scanted all ,
1743,Wherein I should your great deserts repay ,
1744,Forgot upon your dearest love to call ,
1745,Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day ;
1746,That I have frequent been with unknown minds ,
1747,And given to time your own dear-purchas 'd right ;
1748,That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
1749,Which should transport me farthest from your sight .
1750,Book both my wilfulness and errors down ,
1751,And on just proof surmise , accumulate ;
1752,Bring me within the level of your frown ,
1753,But shoot not at me in your waken 'd hate ;
1754,Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
1755,The constancy and virtue of your love .
1756,CXVIII
1757,Like as , to make our appetite more keen ,
1758,With eager compounds we our palate urge ;
1759,As , to prevent our maladies unseen ,
1760,We sicken to shun sickness when we purge ;
1761,Even so , being full of your ne'er - cloying sweetness ,
1762,To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding ;
1763,And , sick of welfare , found a kind of meetness
1764,To be diseas 'd , ere that there was true needing .
1765,Thus policy in love , to anticipate
1766,The ills that were not , grew to faults assur 'd ,
1767,And brought to medicine a healthful state
1768,Which , rank of goodness , would by ill be cur 'd ;
1769,But thence I learn and find the lesson true ,
1770,Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you .
1771,CXIX
1772,What potions have I drunk of Siren tears ,
1773,Distill 'd from limbecks foul as hell within ,
1774,Applying fears to hopes , and hopes to fears ,
1775,Still losing when I saw myself to win !
1776,What wretched errors hath my heart committed ,
1777,Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never !
1778,How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted ,
1779,In the distraction of this madding fever !
1780,O benefit of ill ! now I find true
1781,That better is , by evil still made better ;
1782,And ruin 'd love , when it is built anew ,
1783,Grows fairer than at first , more strong , far greater .
1784,So I return rebuk 'd to my content ,
1785,And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent .
1786,CXX
1787,That you were once unkind befriends me now ,
1788,And for that sorrow , which I then did feel ,
1789,Needs must I under my transgression bow ,
1790,Unless my nerves were brass or hammer 'd steel .
1791,For if you were by my unkindness shaken ,
1792,As I by yours , you 've pass 'd a hell of time ;
1793,And I , a tyrant , have no leisure taken
1794,To weigh how once I suffer 'd in your crime .
1795,O ! that our night of woe might have remember 'd
1796,My deepest sense , how hard true sorrow hits ,
1797,And soon to you , as you to me , then tender 'd
1798,The humble salve , which wounded bosoms fits !
1799,But that your trespass now becomes a fee ;
1800,Mine ransoms yours , and yours must ransom me .
1801,CXXI
1802,` Tis better to be vile than vile esteem 'd ,
1803,When not to be receives reproach of being ;
1804,And the just pleasure lost , which is so deem 'd
1805,Not by our feeling , but by others ' seeing :
1806,For why should others ' false adulterate eyes
1807,Give salutation to my sportive blood ?
1808,Or on my frailties why are frailer spies ,
1809,Which in their wills count bad what I think good ?
1810,No , I am that I am , and they that level
1811,At my abuses reckon up their own :
1812,I may be straight though they themselves be bevel ;
1813,By their rank thoughts , my deeds must not be shown ;
1814,Unless this general evil they maintain ,
1815,All men are bad and in their badness reign .
1816,CXXII
1817,Thy gift , thy tables , are within my brain
1818,Full character 'd with lasting memory ,
1819,Which shall above that idle rank remain ,
1820,Beyond all date ; even to eternity :
1821,Or , at the least , so long as brain and heart
1822,Have faculty by nature to subsist ;
1823,Till each to raz 'd oblivion yield his part
1824,Of thee , thy record never can be miss 'd .
1825,That poor retention could not so much hold ,
1826,Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score ;
1827,Therefore to give them from me was I bold ,
1828,To trust those tables that receive thee more :
1829,To keep an adjunct to remember thee
1830,Were to import forgetfulness in me .
1831,CXXIII
1832,No , Time , thou shalt not boast that I do change :
1833,Thy pyramids built up with newer might
1834,To me are nothing novel , nothing strange ;
1835,They are but dressings of a former sight .
1836,Our dates are brief , and therefore we admire
1837,What thou dost foist upon us that is old ;
1838,And rather make them born to our desire
1839,Than think that we before have heard them told .
1840,Thy registers and thee I both defy ,
1841,Not wondering at the present nor the past ,
1842,For thy records and what we see doth lie ,
1843,Made more or less by thy continual haste .
1844,This I do vow and this shall ever be ;
1845,I will be true despite thy scythe and thee .
1846,CXXIV
1847,If my dear love were but the child of state ,
1848,It might for Fortune 's bastard be unfather 'd ,
1849,As subject to Time 's love or to Time 's hate ,
1850,Weeds among weeds , or flowers with flowers gather 'd .
1851,No , it was builded far from accident ;
1852,It suffers not in smiling pomp , nor falls
1853,Under the blow of thralled discontent ,
1854,Whereto th ' inviting time our fashion calls :
1855,It fears not policy , that heretic ,
1856,Which works on leases of short-number 'd hours ,
1857,But all alone stands hugely politic ,
1858,That it nor grows with heat , nor drowns with showers .
1859,To this I witness call the fools of time ,
1860,Which die for goodness , who have lived for crime .
1861,CXXV
1862,Were ' t aught to me I bore the canopy ,
1863,With my extern the outward honouring ,
1864,Or laid great bases for eternity ,
1865,Which proves more short than waste or ruining ?
1866,Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
1867,Lose all and more by paying too much rent
1868,For compound sweet ; forgoing simple savour ,
1869,Pitiful thrivers , in their gazing spent ?
1870,No ; let me be obsequious in thy heart ,
1871,And take thou my oblation , poor but free ,
1872,Which is not mix 'd with seconds , knows no art ,
1873,But mutual render , only me for thee .
1874,Hence , thou suborned informer ! a true soul
1875,When most impeach 'd , stands least in thy control .
1876,CXXVI
1877,O thou , my lovely boy , who in thy power
1878,Dost hold Time 's fickle glass , his fickle hour ;
1879,Who hast by waning grown , and therein show ` st
1880,Thy lovers withering , as thy sweet self grow ` st.
1881,If Nature , sovereign mistress over wrack ,
1882,As thou goest onwards , still will pluck thee back ,
1883,She keeps thee to this purpose , that her skill
1884,May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill .
1885,Yet fear her , O thou minion of her pleasure !
1886,She may detain , but not still keep , her treasure :
1887,Her audit -LRB- though delayed -RRB- answered must be ,
1888,And her quietus is to render thee .
1889,CXXVII
1890,In the old age black was not counted fair ,
1891,Or if it were , it bore not beauty 's name ;
1892,But now is black beauty 's successive heir ,
1893,And beauty slander 'd with a bastard shame :
1894,For since each hand hath put on Nature 's power ,
1895,Fairing the foul with Art 's false borrowed face ,
1896,Sweet beauty hath no name , no holy bower ,
1897,But is profan 'd , if not lives in disgrace .
1898,Therefore my mistress ' eyes are raven black ,
1899,Her eyes so suited , and they mourners seem
1900,At such who , not born fair , no beauty lack ,
1901,Sland ` ring creation with a false esteem :
1902,Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe ,
1903,That every tongue says beauty should look so .
1904,CXXVIII
1905,How oft when thou , my music , music play ` st ,
1906,Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
1907,With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway ` st
1908,The wiry concord that mine ear confounds ,
1909,Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap ,
1910,To kiss the tender inward of thy hand ,
1911,Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap ,
1912,At the wood 's boldness by thee blushing stand !
1913,To be so tickled , they would change their state
1914,And situation with those dancing chips ,
1915,O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait ,
1916,Making dead wood more bless 'd than living lips .
1917,Since saucy jacks so happy are in this ,
1918,Give them thy fingers , me thy lips to kiss .
1919,CXXIX
1920,The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
1921,Is lust in action : and till action , lust
1922,Is perjur 'd , murderous , bloody , full of blame ,
1923,Savage , extreme , rude , cruel , not to trust ;
1924,Enjoy 'd no sooner but despised straight ;
1925,Past reason hunted ; and no sooner had ,
1926,Past reason hated , as a swallow 'd bait ,
1927,On purpose laid to make the taker mad :
1928,Mad in pursuit and in possession so ;
1929,Had , having , and in quest , to have extreme ;
1930,A bliss in proof , -- and prov 'd , a very woe ;
1931,Before , a joy propos 'd ; behind a dream .
1932,All this the world well knows ; yet none knows well
1933,To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell .

1935,My mistress ' eyes are nothing like the sun ;
1936,Coral is far more red , than her lips red :
1937,If snow be white , why then her breasts are dun ;
1938,If hairs be wires , black wires grow on her head .
1939,I have seen roses damask 'd , red and white ,
1940,But no such roses see I in her cheeks ;
1941,And in some perfumes is there more delight
1942,Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks .
1943,I love to hear her speak , yet well I know
1944,That music hath a far more pleasing sound :
1945,I grant I never saw a goddess go , --
1946,My mistress , when she walks , treads on the ground :
1947,And yet by heaven , I think my love as rare ,
1948,As any she belied with false compare .
1949,CXXXI
1950,Thou art as tyrannous , so as thou art ,
1951,As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel ;
1952,For well thou know ` st to my dear doting heart
1953,Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel .
1954,Yet , in good faith , some say that thee behold ,
1955,Thy face hath not the power to make love groan ;
1956,To say they err I dare not be so bold ,
1957,Although I swear it to myself alone .
1958,And to be sure that is not false I swear ,
1959,A thousand groans , but thinking on thy face ,
1960,One on another 's neck , do witness bear
1961,Thy black is fairest in my judgment 's place .
1962,In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds ,
1963,And thence this slander , as I think , proceeds .
1964,CXXXII
1965,Thine eyes I love , and they , as pitying me ,
1966,Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain ,
1967,Have put on black and loving mourners be ,
1968,Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain .
1969,And truly not the morning sun of heaven
1970,Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east ,
1971,Nor that full star that ushers in the even ,
1972,Doth half that glory to the sober west ,
1973,As those two mourning eyes become thy face :
1974,O ! let it then as well beseem thy heart
1975,To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace ,
1976,And suit thy pity like in every part .
1977,Then will I swear beauty herself is black ,
1978,And all they foul that thy complexion lack .
1979,CXXXIII
1980,Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
1981,For that deep wound it gives my friend and me !
1982,Is ' t not enough to torture me alone ,
1983,But slave to slavery my sweet ` st friend must be ?
1984,Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken ,
1985,And my next self thou harder hast engross 'd :
1986,Of him , myself , and thee I am forsaken ;
1987,A torment thrice three-fold thus to be cross 'd :
1988,Prison my heart in thy steel bosom 's ward ,
1989,But then my friend 's heart let my poor heart bail ;
1990,Whoe'er keeps me , let my heart be his guard ;
1991,Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail :
1992,And yet thou wilt ; for I , being pent in thee ,
1993,Perforce am thine , and all that is in me .
1994,CXXXIV
1995,So , now I have confess 'd that he is thine ,
1996,And I my self am mortgag 'd to thy will ,
1997,Myself I 'll forfeit , so that other mine
1998,Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still :

2000,For thou art covetous , and he is kind ;
2001,He learn 'd but surety-like to write for me ,
2002,Under that bond that him as fast doth bind .
2003,The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take ,
2004,Thou usurer , that putt ` st forth all to use ,
2005,And sue a friend came debtor for my sake ;
2006,So him I lose through my unkind abuse .

2013,To thy sweet will making addition thus .
2014,Wilt thou , whose will is large and spacious ,
2015,Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine ?
2016,Shall will in others seem right gracious ,
2017,And in my will no fair acceptance shine ?
2018,The sea , all water , yet receives rain still ,
2019,And in abundance addeth to his store ;
2020,So thou , being rich in ` Will , ' add to thy ` Will '
2021,One will of mine , to make thy large will more .
2022,Let no unkind ` No ' fair beseechers kill ;
2023,Think all but one , and me in that one ` Will . '

2025,If thy soul check thee that I come so near ,

2029,` Will ' , will fulfil the treasure of thy love ,
2030,Ay , fill it full with wills , and my will one .
2031,In things of great receipt with ease we prove
2032,Among a number one is reckon 'd none :
2033,Then in the number let me pass untold ,
2034,Though in thy store 's account I one must be ;
2035,For nothing hold me , so it please thee hold
2036,That nothing me , a something sweet to thee :
2037,Make but my name thy love , and love that still ,

2040,Thou blind fool , Love , what dost thou to mine eyes ,
2041,That they behold , and see not what they see ?
2042,They know what beauty is , see where it lies ,
2043,Yet what the best is take the worst to be .
2044,If eyes , corrupt by over-partial looks ,
2045,Be anchor 'd in the bay where all men ride ,
2046,Why of eyes ' falsehood hast thou forged hooks ,
2047,Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied ?
2048,Why should my heart think that a several plot ,
2049,Which my heart knows the wide world 's common place ?
2050,Or mine eyes , seeing this , say this is not ,
2051,To put fair truth upon so foul a face ?
2052,In things right true my heart and eyes have err 'd ,
2053,And to this false plague are they now transferr 'd .
2054,CXXXVIII
2055,When my love swears that she is made of truth ,
2056,I do believe her though I know she lies ,
2057,That she might think me some untutor 'd youth ,
2058,Unlearned in the world 's false subtleties .
2059,Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young ,
2060,Although she knows my days are past the best ,
2061,Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue :
2062,On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed :
2063,But wherefore says she not she is unjust ?
2064,And wherefore say not I that I am old ?
2065,O ! love 's best habit is in seeming trust ,
2066,And age in love , loves not to have years told :
2067,Therefore I lie with her , and she with me ,
2068,And in our faults by lies we flatter 'd be .
2069,CXXXIX
2070,O ! call not me to justify the wrong
2071,That thy unkindness lays upon my heart ;
2072,Wound me not with thine eye , but with thy tongue :
2073,Use power with power , and slay me not by art ,
2074,Tell me thou lov ` st elsewhere ; but in my sight ,
2075,Dear heart , forbear to glance thine eye aside :
2076,What need ` st thou wound with cunning , when thy might
2077,Is more than my o'erpress 'd defence can bide ?
2078,Let me excuse thee : ah ! my love well knows
2079,Her pretty looks have been mine enemies ;
2080,And therefore from my face she turns my foes ,
2081,That they elsewhere might dart their injuries :
2082,Yet do not so ; but since I am near slain ,
2083,Kill me outright with looks , and rid my pain .
2084,CXL
2085,Be wise as thou art cruel ; do not press
2086,My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain ;
2087,Lest sorrow lend me words , and words express
2088,The manner of my pity-wanting pain .
2089,If I might teach thee wit , better it were ,
2090,Though not to love , yet , love to tell me so ; --
2091,As testy sick men , when their deaths be near ,
2092,No news but health from their physicians know ; --
2093,For , if I should despair , I should grow mad ,
2094,And in my madness might speak ill of thee ;
2095,Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad ,
2096,Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be .

2098,Bear thine eyes straight , though thy proud heart go wide .
2099,CXLI
2100,In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes ,
2101,For they in thee a thousand errors note ;
2102,But ` tis my heart that loves what they despise ,
2103,Who , in despite of view , is pleased to dote .
2104,Nor are mine ears with thy tongue 's tune delighted ;
2105,Nor tender feeling , to base touches prone ,
2106,Nor taste , nor smell , desire to be invited
2107,To any sensual feast with thee alone :
2108,But my five wits nor my five senses can
2109,Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee ,
2110,Who leaves unsway 'd the likeness of a man ,
2111,Thy proud heart 's slave and vassal wretch to be :
2112,Only my plague thus far I count my gain ,
2113,That she that makes me sin awards me pain .

2115,Love is my sin , and thy dear virtue hate ,
2116,Hate of my sin , grounded on sinful loving :
2117,O ! but with mine compare thou thine own state ,
2118,And thou shalt find it merits not reproving ;
2119,Or , if it do , not from those lips of thine ,
2120,That have profan 'd their scarlet ornaments
2121,And seal 'd false bonds of love as oft as mine ,
2122,Robb 'd others ' beds ' revenues of their rents .
2123,Be it lawful I love thee , as thou lov ` st those
2124,Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee :
2125,Root pity in thy heart , that , when it grows ,
2126,Thy pity may deserve to pitied be .
2127,If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide ,
2128,By self-example mayst thou be denied !

2130,Lo , as a careful housewife runs to catch
2131,One of her feather 'd creatures broke away ,
2132,Sets down her babe , and makes all swift dispatch
2133,In pursuit of the thing she would have stay ;
2134,Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase ,
2135,Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
2136,To follow that which flies before her face ,
2137,Not prizing her poor infant 's discontent ;
2138,So runn ` st thou after that which flies from thee ,
2139,Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind ;
2140,But if thou catch thy hope , turn back to me ,
2141,And play the mother 's part , kiss me , be kind ;

2145,Two loves I have of comfort and despair ,

2147,The better angel is a man right fair ,
2148,The worser spirit a woman colour 'd ill .
2149,To win me soon to hell , my female evil ,
2150,Tempteth my better angel from my side ,
2151,And would corrupt my saint to be a devil ,
2152,Wooing his purity with her foul pride .
2153,And whether that my angel be turn 'd fiend ,
2154,Suspect I may , yet not directly tell ;
2155,But being both from me , both to each friend ,
2156,I guess one angel in another 's hell :
2157,Yet this shall I ne'er know , but live in doubt ,
2158,Till my bad angel fire my good one out .
2159,CXLV
2160,Those lips that Love 's own hand did make ,
2161,Breathed forth the sound that said ' I hate ' ,
2162,To me that languish 'd for her sake :
2163,But when she saw my woeful state ,
2164,Straight in her heart did mercy come ,
2165,Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
2166,Was us 'd in giving gentle doom ;
2167,And taught it thus anew to greet ;
2168,' I hate ' she alter 'd with an end ,
2169,That followed it as gentle day ,
2170,Doth follow night , who like a fiend
2171,From heaven to hell is flown away .

2179,Why so large cost , having so short a lease ,
2180,Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend ?
2181,Shall worms , inheritors of this excess ,
2182,Eat up thy charge ? Is this thy body 's end ?
2183,Then soul , live thou upon thy servant 's loss ,
2184,And let that pine to aggravate thy store ;
2185,Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross ;
2186,Within be fed , without be rich no more :

2190,My love is as a fever longing still ,
2191,For that which longer nurseth the disease ;

2195,Angry that his prescriptions are not kept ,
2196,Hath left me , and I desperate now approve
2197,Desire is death , which physic did except .

2209,If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote ,

2254,For , thou betraying me , I do betray
2255,My nobler part to my gross body 's treason ;
