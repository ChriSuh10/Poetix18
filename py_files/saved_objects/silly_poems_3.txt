Im not sure why he was sent from my house
He was a relative
a drug dealer
out there trying to get nothing out

 A sailor no one cared about
Nobody knew James
He was young and well dressed
He was an excellent gift to the mind

 The streets were filled with grayish lights
and the old oak showed
prominently
the variety of the tree

 Why would Rupert marry this good vixen
he repeated
and they exchanged a glance
You have what it takes to whore a man

 And wed sold six times before
Before I changed his wife
which was really tricky
As the kings storeroom was in the street

 It was over nearly an hour
when he took dear Holmes
talking way too fast
musing on a desire

 He asked Rolls for a meeting
When the meetings closed
he went to Rhodes
Both of them wanted an actor

 We had heard no other names besides his
so we fished out a washcloth
and laid him fast to the ground
Then when James reached the barn he freed us all

 After his initial teaching sessions
he sat on a stool
sitting on the floor
leaning heavily on me

 It could be very convenient
In the real result
James would break the book further
It cannot be said that the will was
