As the inverted square

Of the distance from object to source."

Succeeds to describe gravitation

As spacetime that's curved,
And it's this that will serve

As the planets' unique motivation.

By a new way of thinking we're smitten.

We twist and we turn,
Attempting to learn

The Superstring Theory of Witten!
