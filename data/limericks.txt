Who endured all the lows and the highs
That her children went through
Like the mumps or the flu
Or the joy of a pleasant surprise

And wiped away tears from our eyes
She forgave all our flaws
And our social faux pas
And she baked really great apple pies

And plied us with sodas and fries
When our manners were good
And we did what we should
She was righteous and caring and wise

So to Mothers, both present and past
For the many good deeds you've amassed
I honor you all
With this verse on my wall
And I hope that your day is a blast

On a turkey that's freshly deceased
Or a slow roasted duck
That has run out of pluck
Or a lamb that's been recently fleeced

Many places are holding parades
With traffic cut off by blockades
As folks line the streets
And as cops walk the beats
Of their city and town promenades

So that many a cute little kid
Can damage their teeth
And their gums underneath
In a sugary takeover bid

While indulging in crackers with Brie
Washing down with some suds
Such as Molsons or Buds
Then I'll empty myself when I pee

So I hope you all have a good Easter
As you sit in your den on your keester
Or chill out with your chums
Or be flapping your gums
On the phone with your brother or seester
